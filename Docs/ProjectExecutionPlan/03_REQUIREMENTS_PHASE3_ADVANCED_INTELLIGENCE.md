# Requirements: Phase 3 - Advanced Intelligence & System Hardening

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2025-05-27

## 1. Goal

To significantly enhance the Nucleus platform's intelligence and robustness by implementing advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies within the `RAGPipelineMCP`, enabling dynamic persona configuration and behavior through the `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`, introducing effective caching mechanisms, establishing comprehensive system-level automated testing, and integrating initial operational telemetry. These enhancements are critical for supporting sophisticated, reliable, and observable operations of Microsoft 365 Agents and their underlying Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus (MCP Tools & Supporting Services):**
    *   **Advanced RAG (`RAGPipelineMCP`):** Implementing sophisticated query strategies, including hybrid search, metadata filtering, and the "4 R" Ranking System (Recency, Relevancy, Richness, Reputation), within the `RAGPipelineMCP` to improve the quality of context provided to M365 Agents.
    *   **Dynamic Persona Configuration (`PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`):** Developing the `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` to allow for dynamic loading, validation, and application of persona configurations (prompts, tool access, behavioral guidelines) that M365 Agents will use.
    *   **AI Model Interaction:** Optimizing interactions with the configured AI model (e.g., Google Gemini via `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`), focusing on prompt engineering for RAG, managing context windows effectively, and parsing structured outputs for agent consumption.
    *   **Caching (`CachingMCP` - Conceptual):** Designing and implementing caching mechanisms, potentially exposed via a dedicated `CachingMCP` or integrated into other MCP Tools, to reduce latency and redundant computations for frequently accessed data or expensive AI calls.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Ensuring robust and secure configuration management (`Microsoft.Extensions.Options`, Azure Key Vault) for all backend components, including persona-specific settings accessible via `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`.
    *   **Automated System Testing:** Expanding unit and integration test coverage to include end-to-end system tests that simulate M365 Agent interactions with the suite of MCP Tools. This includes emulating dependencies like M365 services (e.g., Graph API responses), Cosmos DB (e.g., using Testcontainers), and AI model responses.
    *   **Operational Telemetry:** Integrating basic operational telemetry (e.g., using Application Insights) to monitor the health, performance, and usage of MCP Tools and backend services.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the M365 Agent integration and foundational MCP Tools established in Phase 2 ([`02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_ENHANCEMENTS.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Advanced RAG Pipeline (`RAGPipelineMCP`)

*   **REQ-P3-RAG-001:** The `RAGPipelineMCP` MUST implement advanced query strategies, including:
    *   Hybrid search combining vector similarity with keyword/metadata-based filtering on `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records in Cosmos DB, leveraging the `KnowledgeStoreMCP`.
    *   Configurable implementation of the **"4 R" Ranking System (Recency, Relevancy, Richness, Reputation)** to re-rank and select the most pertinent information.
    *   Ability to synthesize information from multiple retrieved sources to construct comprehensive context for the M365 Agent.
*   **REQ-P3-RAG-002:** The `RAGPipelineMCP` MUST provide clear source attribution (e.g., `ArtifactReference` identifiers, metadata from `KnowledgeStoreMCP`) for all retrieved and ranked content, enabling transparency and verifiability for the M365 Agent.
*   **REQ-P3-RAG-003:** The `RAGPipelineMCP` SHOULD allow for persona-specific overrides or configurations for its ranking and retrieval logic, potentially managed via `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`.

### 3.2. Dynamic Persona Configuration & Behavior (`PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`)

*   **REQ-P3-PBC-001:** The `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` MUST allow M365 Agents to retrieve persona-specific configurations, including:
    *   System prompts and behavioral guidelines.
    *   Available tools and their usage constraints.
    *   Parameters for interacting with other MCP Tools (e.g., `RAGPipelineMCP` settings).
*   **REQ-P3-PBC-002:** Persona configurations MUST be securely stored (e.g., in Cosmos DB, managed by `KnowledgeStoreMCP` or a dedicated configuration store) and validated upon loading by the `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`.
*   **REQ-P3-PBC-003:** The `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` MUST support versioning of persona configurations to allow for controlled updates and rollbacks.
*   **REQ-P3-PBC-004:** The system SHOULD provide a mechanism (e.g., an admin interface or CLI tool) for managing and updating persona configurations that the `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` serves.

### 3.3. Caching Implementation (Conceptual `CachingMCP` or Integrated)

*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-001:** A robust caching strategy MUST be designed and implemented to improve performance and reduce costs. This may manifest as a dedicated `CachingMCP` or be integrated into relevant MCP Tools.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-002:** Caching logic MUST be strategically integrated into performance-sensitive areas, such as:
    *   Caching results from expensive AI model calls (respecting data volatility and context).
    *   Caching frequently accessed persona configurations from `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`.
    *   Caching frequently retrieved data from `KnowledgeStoreMCP` or `RAGPipelineMCP` outputs.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-003:** Cache expiration and invalidation strategies MUST be implemented to ensure data freshness and consistency. Distributed caching (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis) SHOULD be used for scalability.

### 3.4. Configuration Management (System-Wide)

*   **REQ-P3-CONF-001:** Comprehensive configuration schemas MUST be defined and maintained for all MCP Tools and backend services.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-002:** Configuration MUST continue to be loaded using `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` and support environment-specific overrides.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-003:** All sensitive configuration values (API keys, connection strings) MUST be stored and accessed securely using Azure Key Vault, integrated via managed identities.

### 3.5. Automated System Testing

*   **REQ-P3-TEST-001:** End-to-end automated system tests MUST be developed to validate the interactions between M365 Agents and the suite of MCP Tools (`FileAccessMCP`, `ContentProcessingMCP`, `KnowledgeStoreMCP`, `RAGPipelineMCP`, `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`).
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-002:** System tests MUST simulate realistic M365 Agent scenarios, including:
    *   Fetching and processing files.
    *   Storing and retrieving knowledge.
    *   Applying persona configurations.
    *   Generating responses based on RAG outputs.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-003:** Test infrastructure MUST include robust mocking/emulation for external dependencies:
    *   M365 services (e.g., Microsoft Graph API responses).
    *   AI model responses (e.g., using `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` or custom mocks).
    *   Azure Cosmos DB (e.g., using the emulator or Testcontainers).
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-004:** Performance and basic load testing SHOULD be introduced for critical MCP Tool endpoints to identify bottlenecks.

### 3.6. Operational Telemetry & Monitoring

*   **REQ-P3-TELEMETRY-001:** Basic operational telemetry MUST be integrated into all MCP Tools and critical backend services using Azure Application Insights.
*   **REQ-P3-TELEMETRY-002:** Telemetry MUST capture key metrics, including:
    *   Request rates and latencies for MCP Tool operations.
    *   Error rates and exception details.
    *   Dependency call performance (e.g., to Cosmos DB, AI models).
    *   Basic usage patterns (e.g., which personas are invoked, types of queries).
*   **REQ-P3-TELEMETRY-003:** Dashboards or alerts SHOULD be configured in Azure Monitor to provide visibility into system health and performance.

## 4. Non-Goals (This Phase)

*   Developing new user-facing client adapters beyond supporting M365 Agents.
*   Introducing fundamentally new external *platform* integrations (focus remains on M365 as the primary client platform).
*   Advanced, self-healing capabilities or fully autonomous agentic systems beyond the defined M365 Agent + MCP Tool interaction model.
*   A dedicated UI for end-user persona customization (management is via admin tools/APIs).

## 5. Key Dependencies & Linkages

*   **M365 Agent SDK & MCP Specifications:** Continued alignment with these evolving standards.
*   **Phase 2 Requirements:** [`02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_ENHANCEMENTS.md) - This phase builds directly upon the foundational MCP tools and M365 Agent integration.
