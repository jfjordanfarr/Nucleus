# Educator Persona Knowledge Trees

## Overview

The Educator persona utilizes a dual knowledge framework represented by two distinct but complementary tree structures: the Pedagogical Tree and the Tautological Tree. This framework allows the persona to analyze learning artifacts and activities through two lenses:

1.  **The Pedagogical Lens:** Focuses on the development of genuine skills, subject matter knowledge, and conceptual understanding within specific educational domains (e.g., Literacy, Numeracy, Science, Arts). It represents *what* the child is learning in terms of curriculum-aligned or real-world capabilities.

2.  **The Tautological Lens:** Focuses on the underlying cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and creative *processes* being developed and demonstrated. It captures *how* the child is learning and developing foundational abilities (e.g., Symbolic Reasoning, Pattern Recognition, Collaboration, Fine Motor Control), often aligning with developmental psychology milestones or formal reporting requirements mandated by educational systems.

## Purpose and Application

The Educator persona uses these trees to:

*   **Analyze Learning Artifacts:** Evaluate submitted work (like projects, observations, or interactions with educational tools like the [Numeracy and Timelines Web App Concept](./NumeracyAndTimelinesWebappConcept.md)) to identify evidence of skills and processes defined in the trees.
*   **Map Progress:** Connect observed activities and achievements to specific nodes in both trees, providing a comprehensive view of development.
*   **Identify Gaps:** Recognize areas where a learner might need more support or exposure.
*   **Facilitate Reporting:** Translate authentic learning experiences (captured via the Pedagogical Tree) into the language of formal requirements (often reflected in the Tautological Tree), aiding in documentation for homeschooling portfolios or institutional reporting.
*   **Generate Insights:** Potentially create visualizations or summaries (similar in concept to the [DATAVIZ Template](../../Processing/Dataviz/ARCHITECTURE_DATAVIZ_TEMPLATE.md)) showing progress across different domains and processes over time.

## Age-Specific Breakdowns

The detailed, age-specific definitions for both the Pedagogical and Tautological Trees, covering expected capabilities from approximately Age 5 through Age 18, are maintained in the following sub-directory:

*   [`./Pedagogical_And_Tautological_Trees_Of_Knowledge/`](./Pedagogical_And_Tautological_Trees_Of_Knowledge/)

Each file within this directory (e.g., `Age05.md`, `Age10.md`) contains the specific tree structures relevant to the capabilities typically expected by the end of that year.
