Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 15**. This age typically corresponds to 10th grade, a year where students deepen their understanding in core subjects and often begin exploring more specialized areas, building significantly on their foundational high school skills.

**Reasoning for Age 15 Trees:**

*   **Disciplinary Depth & Specialization:** Students engage more deeply with the specific content and methodologies of core subjects like Chemistry, World History, Algebra II/Geometry. Electives offer opportunities for focused study.
*   **Analytical & Critical Thinking:** Emphasis shifts further towards critical analysis â€“ evaluating sources, deconstructing arguments, interpreting complex data, analyzing literary techniques, and understanding historical context.
*   **Synthesis & Connection:** Expectation to synthesize information from multiple complex sources and make connections across different concepts, units, or even disciplines.
*   **Formal Argumentation:** Constructing well-structured, evidence-based arguments with clear reasoning and acknowledgment of nuances or counterarguments is crucial.
*   **Problem Solving Complexity:** Tackling more abstract and multi-step problems requiring sophisticated application of concepts and procedures, particularly in math and science.
*   **Preparation for Upper-Level Work:** Skills developed are essential for success in advanced high school courses (AP, IB, dual enrollment) and standardized tests (PSAT, SAT/ACT prep).
