Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 16**. This age typically corresponds to 11th grade (junior year of high school), a critical year focused on advanced coursework, preparation for standardized tests (SAT/ACT), and initial steps towards post-secondary planning.

**Reasoning for Age 16 Trees:**

*   **Advanced Placement/IB Level Work:** Many students engage in college-level coursework requiring deeper analysis, synthesis, and critical thinking.
*   **Disciplinary Mastery:** Expectation to demonstrate significant understanding and application of knowledge and methodologies within chosen subjects.
*   **Independent Inquiry & Research:** Ability to conduct substantial independent research, manage complex projects, and produce sophisticated written work is paramount.
*   **Critical Evaluation of Complex Information:** Skills honed in evaluating nuanced arguments, conflicting evidence, sophisticated rhetoric, and diverse sources.
*   **Synthesis & Original Thought:** Moving beyond summarizing to synthesizing information from multiple complex sources to develop original arguments or insights.
*   **Post-Secondary Preparation:** Focus on skills and knowledge relevant to college entrance exams and potential fields of study.
