Okay, let's focus on Age 5. At this stage, learning is highly integrated, experiential, and focused on foundational skills that prepare children for more formal schooling. Play is a primary mode of learning. The trees will reflect this emphasis on emergent abilities and concrete experiences.

**Reasoning for Age 5 Trees:**

*   **Integration:** Subjects are less distinct. A single activity (like playing with blocks) hits Math (shapes, counting), Science (stability), Language (describing), Social (sharing), Creative (designing), and Physical (motor skills). The trees attempt to categorize the *intended focus* or *primary outcome* while acknowledging this overlap.
*   **Emergence:** Many skills are just beginning. We'll see nodes like "Emergent Writing" or "Pre-Reading Skills."
*   **Concreteness:** Learning is tied to tangible objects, direct experiences, and immediate environments (self, family, classroom, nature). Abstract concepts are introduced simply.
*   **Play-Based:** Much learning happens through structured and unstructured play. The trees represent the underlying skills being developed during play.
*   **Social-Emotional Core:** This age is crucial for developing self-regulation, understanding social rules, and interacting with peers. This will be prominent, especially in the Tautological tree.
