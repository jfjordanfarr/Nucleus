Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 12**. This age typically corresponds to 6th or 7th grade, marking a deeper dive into middle school curriculum and requiring more sophisticated abstract thinking and independent learning skills.

**Reasoning for Age 12 Trees:**

*   **Abstract & Hypothetical Thinking:** Students increasingly engage with abstract concepts (e.g., negative numbers, variables, historical causality, scientific models) and hypothetical scenarios ("what if").
*   **Subject Depth:** Content within subjects becomes more specialized and complex. Expectation for deeper analysis and application of knowledge.
*   **Argumentation & Evidence:** Developing stronger argumentative skills, including acknowledging and refuting counterclaims (simple), and using specific evidence effectively.
*   **Research & Synthesis:** Research projects require evaluating a wider range of sources, synthesizing information coherently, and citing properly.
*   **Problem Solving:** Tackling more complex, multi-step problems across disciplines, often requiring integration of different skills or concepts.
*   **Self-Management:** Increased responsibility for managing long-term assignments, organizing work across multiple subjects, and utilizing effective study habits.
