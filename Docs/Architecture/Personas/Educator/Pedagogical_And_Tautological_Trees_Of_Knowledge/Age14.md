Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 14**. This age typically marks the transition into or the first year of high school (around 9th grade), demanding a higher level of abstract thinking, disciplinary knowledge, and independent learning.

**Reasoning for Age 14 Trees:**

*   **Foundation for Advanced Study:** Skills and knowledge are geared towards preparing for more specialized and rigorous high school courses (e.g., advanced math sequences, AP/IB preparatory work).
*   **Discipline-Specific Inquiry:** Increased emphasis on thinking and working within the specific methodologies of different academic disciplines (scientific method, historical analysis, literary criticism, mathematical proof - basic concepts).
*   **Complex Argumentation & Synthesis:** Constructing nuanced arguments, synthesizing information from multiple complex sources, and addressing counterarguments thoughtfully are key skills.
*   **Abstract Modeling & Representation:** Using abstract models (mathematical equations, scientific diagrams, historical frameworks) to represent and analyze complex phenomena becomes more common.
*   **Independent Research & Project Management:** Expectation to conduct more independent research, manage longer-term projects, and present findings effectively.
*   **Personalization & Choice:** Depending on the system, students might begin having more choices in their coursework (electives, language tracks), though core subjects remain central.
