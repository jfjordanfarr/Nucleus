Okay, let's develop the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 9**. This age often marks a significant step up in academic complexity, typically falling within 3rd or 4th grade. Children are expected to apply foundational skills more independently and tackle more abstract concepts.

**Reasoning for Age 9 Trees:**

*   **Application Focus:** Basic facts (math, phonics) are assumed to be largely mastered; the emphasis is on using them in multi-step problems, longer texts, and structured writing.
*   **Increased Abstraction:** Concepts like multiplication/division relationships, fractions on a number line, historical cause/effect, ecosystems, and basic governmental functions become more central.
*   **Research & Organization Skills:** Introduction to basic research skills â€“ using text features, taking simple notes, organizing information logically.
*   **Complex Text Comprehension:** Reading and understanding longer chapter books and informational texts, identifying themes, summarizing, and comparing texts.
*   **Structured Writing:** Writing multi-paragraph pieces with clearer organization, introductions/conclusions, and supporting details.
*   **Developing Independence:** Greater expectation for self-management in completing tasks, organizing materials, and monitoring own understanding.
