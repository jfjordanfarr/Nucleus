Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 10**. This age typically falls within 4th or 5th grade and represents a significant step towards more abstract thinking and independent learning, often serving as a bridge to middle school expectations.

**Reasoning for Age 10 Trees:**

*   **Increased Abstraction & Complexity:** Operations with decimals and fractions become more prominent. Reading involves analyzing themes and author's craft. Writing requires more structure and evidence. Science explores systems and energy transfer. Social studies delves into more complex historical narratives and governmental structures.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Students are expected to gather information from multiple sources, evaluate them simply, and synthesize findings into reports or presentations.
*   **Argumentation & Evidence:** Beginning to form arguments supported by evidence from texts or data.
*   **Independence & Organization:** Greater expectation for managing assignments, organizing materials, and using study strategies.
*   **Fluency Application:** Applying mastered basic skills (reading fluency, math facts) to solve complex, multi-step problems and comprehend challenging texts.
