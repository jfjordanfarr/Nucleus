Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 11**. This age typically corresponds to 5th or 6th grade, a critical transition period demanding greater independence, abstract thinking, and organizational skills.

**Reasoning for Age 11 Trees:**

*   **Middle School Readiness:** Focus shifts towards skills needed for success in a departmentalized middle school setting â€“ managing multiple subjects, longer-term assignments, and increased academic rigor.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Students engage more deeply with abstract concepts across subjects: ratios, proportions, variables in math; analyzing themes and author's craft in ELA; understanding systems and models in science; analyzing government structures and historical causality in social studies.
*   **Information Literacy & Argument:** Research involves evaluating sources more critically and synthesizing information. Argumentative writing requires clear claims, relevant evidence, and addressing counterclaims simply.
*   **Systems Thinking:** Emphasis on understanding interconnectedness within systems (biological, ecological, social, governmental).
*   **Independence & Metacognition:** Higher expectations for self-directed learning, time management, organization, and using strategies to monitor comprehension and task completion.
