# Age 17 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 17**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 17 (typically 11th or 12th Grade) is often focused on applying knowledge in complex ways, completing college applications or post-secondary plans, and demonstrating intellectual independence.

**Reasoning for Age 17 Trees:**

*   **Culmination & Mastery:** Expectation to demonstrate mastery in core subjects and chosen areas of specialization through advanced coursework, capstone projects, or comprehensive exams.
*   **Independent Application & Research:** Ability to independently design, execute, and present significant research or projects is highly valued.
*   **Critical Synthesis & Originality:** Moving beyond analysis to synthesizing diverse, complex information to formulate original arguments, interpretations, or solutions.
*   **Disciplinary Fluency:** Ability to think, communicate, and problem-solve using the methods and language of specific academic disciplines at a pre-collegiate level.
*   **Transition Readiness:** Possessing the academic skills (critical thinking, research, writing, quantitative reasoning) and self-management skills (time management, organization, self-advocacy) needed for college or career entry.
*   **Civic & Global Engagement:** Developing a more informed and critical perspective on complex societal and global issues, and understanding pathways for engagement.
