Okay, let's generate the Pedagogical and Tautological trees for the capabilities expected by the end of **Age 13**. This age typically falls within 7th or 8th grade, a time of significant cognitive development towards more abstract and analytical thinking, and increased academic specialization.

**Reasoning for Age 13 Trees:**

*   **Formal Abstract Thought:** Solidifying ability to think abstractly, manipulate variables, understand complex systems, and engage in hypothetical reasoning. Algebra becomes central in math.
*   **Disciplinary Thinking:** Beginning to think more like a historian, scientist, mathematician, etc., using discipline-specific methods of inquiry and argumentation.
*   **Sophisticated Argumentation:** Constructing arguments with clear claims, counterclaims, strong evidence, and logical reasoning becomes a key focus, especially in ELA and Social Studies.
*   **Critical Source Evaluation:** Moving beyond basic credibility checks to analyzing author's perspective, purpose, bias, and rhetorical strategies in sources.
*   **Complex Problem Solving:** Tackling multi-step problems requiring strategic planning, application of multiple concepts, and evaluation of solutions across disciplines.
*   **Increased Self-Direction:** Greater expectation for independent learning, managing complex long-term projects, and utilizing metacognitive strategies.
