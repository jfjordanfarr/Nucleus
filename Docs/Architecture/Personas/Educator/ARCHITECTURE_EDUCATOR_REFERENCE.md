# Reference Implementation: Educator Persona

This document outlines conceptual architecture, data flow, and key models for implementing the Educator (EduFlow OmniEducator) persona.

## 1. High-Level Component Architecture (Conceptual)

**Purpose:** Shows the interaction of components specifically focused on the Educator persona's functions, assuming deployment within a cloud environment (e.g., Azure).

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph User Interaction (Learner/Parent/Educator App)
        User([fa:fa-user User])
    end

    subgraph Nucleus Core Services
        IngestionAPI[fa:fa-cloud-upload Nucleus Ingestion API]
        QueryAPI[fa:fa-search Nucleus Query API]
        Queue[fa:fa-envelope Message Queue]
        ProcessingSvc[fa:fa-cogs Nucleus Processing Service]
        KnowledgeDB[fa:fa-database Cosmos DB]
        AI_SVC[fa:fa-microchip Configured AI Model (Gemini)]
        Config[fa:fa-cog System Configuration]
    end

    subgraph Educator Persona Components
        EducatorModule[fa:fa-brain Educator Persona Logic]
        LearningFacets[fa:fa-tags Learning Facets Schema]
        StandardsMapping[fa:fa-link Curriculum Standards DB]
    end

    User -- 1. Submits Artifact / Query --> IngestionAPI / QueryAPI
    IngestionAPI -- 2a. Creates ArtifactMetadata --> KnowledgeDB
    IngestionAPI -- 2b. Enqueues Job --> Queue
    Queue -- 3. Triggers --> ProcessingSvc
    ProcessingSvc -- 4. Reads/Updates --> KnowledgeDB %% ArtifactMetadata %%
    ProcessingSvc -- 5. Invokes --> EducatorModule
    EducatorModule -- 6. Analyzes Artifact Content --> AI_SVC
    EducatorModule -- 7. Applies Schema --> LearningFacets
    EducatorModule -- 8. Maps to Standards --> StandardsMapping
    EducatorModule -- 9. Generates Analysis --> ProcessingSvc
    ProcessingSvc -- 10. Generates Embeddings --> AI_SVC
    ProcessingSvc -- 11. Writes PersonaKnowledgeEntry --> KnowledgeDB
    QueryAPI -- 12a. Receives Query --> EducatorModule
    EducatorModule -- 12b. Retrieves Data --> KnowledgeDB
    EducatorModule -- 12c. Synthesizes Response --> AI_SVC
    EducatorModule -- 12d. Returns Response --> QueryAPI
    QueryAPI -- 13. Returns Response --> User

    Config -- Manages Settings --> ProcessingSvc
    Config -- Manages Settings --> EducatorModule
    Config -- Manages Settings --> AI_SVC
```

**Explanation:** User interactions (submitting artifacts or querying) go through dedicated APIs. Artifact ingestion triggers asynchronous processing via a queue. The Processing Service coordinates with the Educator Persona Module, which utilizes AI services, internal schemas (Learning Facets), and potentially external standards databases to analyze content. Results (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) are stored in Cosmos DB. Queries are handled more directly, retrieving stored knowledge and synthesizing answers.

## 2. Core Data Model Summary

This persona relies heavily on structured data captured during the 'slow path' analysis, stored as `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents. These entries link back to the source `ArtifactMetadata` and reference conceptual models like:

*   **`LearnerProfile`**: Represents the individual learner.
*   **`Goal`**: Tracks learning objectives.
*   **`LearningActivity` / `Project`**: Describes the context of artifact creation.
*   **`LearningArtifact` / `LearningEvidence`**: (Stored as `ArtifactMetadata`) The source material.
*   **`KnowledgeDomain`**: Classifies content using both Pedagogical Subjects (e.g., Math, Art) and Foundational Capabilities (e.g., Critical Thinking, Problem Solving).
*   **`Skill`**: Specific abilities demonstrated within domains.

**Key `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` Fields (Conceptual for Educator):**

*   `artifactId` (Link to `ArtifactMetadata`)
*   `learnerId`
*   `analysisTimestamp`
*   `analysisType`: "LearningEvidenceAnalysis"
*   `summary`: AI-generated summary of the artifact's educational relevance.
*   `identifiedDomains`: List<[`KnowledgeDomain.domain_id`, confidence_score]>
*   `identifiedSkills`: List<[`Skill.skill_id`, confidence_score, evidence_snippet]>
*   `learningFacetsAnalysis`: JSON object detailing observations based on the Facets schema (e.g., { "problemSolving": { "level": "Applied", "evidence": "..." }, ... })
*   `standardMappings`: List<[`Standard.standard_id`, relevance_score]>
*   `vectorEmbeddings`: List<{ `snippet`: string, `embedding`: float[] }>

```

**Explanation:** The Educator persona prioritizes capturing learning from authentic activities, analyzing it through multiple lenses (subject matter and cognitive processes), storing this rich data securely per learner, and enabling powerful querying for insights. Its design emphasizes privacy and adaptability.

## 4. Potential Future Extensions

*   **Interactive Learning Tools:** Leverage Nucleus's ability to execute tools (e.g., `PROCESSING_DATAVIZ`) to create small, tailored learning games or exercises dynamically.
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Based on analyzed progress, suggest related activities or areas for exploration.
*   **Collaborative Features:** Allow sharing of progress or insights between learners, parents, and educators (with explicit consent).
*   **Advanced Standards Alignment:** Deeper integration with specific curriculum standards databases.
