# Ingestion Architecture: File Collections (e.g., Zip Archives)

## 1. Role and Overview

The File Collections processor handles artifacts that represent containers holding multiple individual files, such as Zip archives (`.zip`), Tarballs (`.tar.gz`, `.tgz`), or potentially other package formats. Its primary goal is to unpack the container and recursively process each constituent file using the appropriate ingestion processor ([Plaintext](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md), [Multimedia](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md), etc.), ensuring that the relationships between the container and its contents are preserved in the metadata.

This processor adheres to the overall ingestion principles ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md)) by ensuring each contained file ultimately results in a faithful textual representation stored without premature chunking.

## 2. Processing Steps

1.  **Receive Collection:** Accepts the container artifact (e.g., zip file stream/bytes).
2.  **Create Container Metadata Stub:** Creates an initial `ArtifactMetadata` record for the container artifact itself (e.g., the zip file). This marks the container as 'Processing'.
3.  **Unpack Contents:** Extracts the constituent files from the container into a temporary location.
4.  **Process Multimedia & Collect Components:** Iterates through the extracted files:
    *   **If Multimedia:** Dispatches to the **Multimedia** processor ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md)). Waits for the LLM-generated text description and stores it temporarily (in memory or temp variable).
    *   **If Text/XML/Relevant:** Reads the file content into a temporary variable (e.g., reads `word/document.xml` content).
    *   Collects all relevant raw text/XML content strings and all generated multimedia description strings.
5.  **Dispatch Bundle for Synthesis:** Bundles *all* collected relevant XML/text content strings and *all* generated multimedia descriptions together. Dispatches this entire bundle to the **Plaintext Processor** ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md)) with a specific instruction (e.g., "Synthesize a single coherent Markdown document representing the original container artifact from these components").
6.  **Await Synthesized Markdown & Update Metadata:** Waits for the Plaintext processor to return the synthesized Markdown content. Updates the *original container's* `ArtifactMetadata` record to point directly to this synthesized Markdown content and marks the container's overall processing state as completed.
7.  **Cleanup:** Removes the temporarily extracted files and intermediate component data.

## 3. Key Principles & Considerations

*   **Component Aggregation:** This processor acts primarily as an unpacker and aggregator of textual components (original text/XML + generated descriptions).
*   **Delegated Synthesis:** The complex task of synthesizing a final document from components is delegated to the Plaintext processor's LLM.
*   **Metadata Simplicity:** Focuses on linking the original container artifact directly to the synthesized Markdown content. Intermediate components might not have persistent metadata.
*   **LLM Dependency:** The quality of the synthesized output heavily depends on the Plaintext processor's LLM's ability to interpret the bundled components and synthesis instructions correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Needs robust handling for corrupted archives, errors during multimedia processing, and potential failures during the final LLM synthesis step.
*   **Nested Collections:** Can still handle nested archives by recursively invoking itself, but the final synthesis step happens at each level for the components within that specific container.
*   **Resource Limits:** Still needs to manage resources for unpacking and holding intermediate components in memory/temp storage before the final synthesis dispatch.

This processor ensures complex container artifacts are deconstructed, their essential textual/visual information is captured (via raw text or LLM descriptions), and then intelligently re-synthesized into a single, coherent Markdown representation by the Plaintext processor's LLM.

## 4. Example: Processing a Word Document (.docx)

Microsoft Word `.docx` files illustrate this LLM-centric synthesis approach:

The processing flow:

1.  **Receipt & Dispatch:** `.docx` received, identified as a File Collection, dispatched to this processor.
2.  **Container Metadata:** Stub created for the `.docx` file.
3.  **Unpack:** Archive unpacked:
    *   `word/document.xml`
    *   `word/styles.xml`
    *   `word/media/image1.png`
    *   `word/media/image2.jpg`
    *   ...etc.
4.  **Process Multimedia & Collect Components:**
    *   `image1.png` -> Multimedia Processor -> LLM -> Returns `description1_text`.
    *   `image2.jpg` -> Multimedia Processor -> LLM -> Returns `description2_text`.
    *   Reads content of `document.xml` into `doc_xml_content` string.
    *   Reads content of `styles.xml` into `styles_xml_content` string.
    *   (Other relevant XML/text components collected similarly).
5.  **Dispatch Bundle for Synthesis:** Sends a bundle containing (`doc_xml_content`, `styles_xml_content`, ..., `description1_text`, `description2_text`) to the **Plaintext Processor** with instruction: "Synthesize Markdown for Word doc from this XML and image descriptions."
6.  **Await Synthesized Markdown & Update Metadata:** Plaintext processor uses its LLM with the bundle, generates synthesized Markdown content, and passes it back. The `.docx` container's `ArtifactMetadata` is updated to point directly to this synthesized Markdown content and marked complete.
7.  **Cleanup:** Temporary files and component strings deleted.

**Outcome:** The single `.docx` artifact is now represented by its metadata record pointing directly to **synthesized Markdown content**, intelligently generated by an LLM from the original document's core XML structure and LLM-generated descriptions of its embedded images. This synthesized Markdown content is now the basis for search and retrieval.

This LLM-driven synthesis approach radically simplifies the pipeline by avoiding dedicated Office parsers, fully embracing the "common sense engine" capability of modern LLMs operating on large context windows.
