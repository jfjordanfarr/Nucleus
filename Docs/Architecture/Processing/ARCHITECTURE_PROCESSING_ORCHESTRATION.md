# Nucleus: Processing Orchestration Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Orchestration** sub-domain within the overall [Processing Architecture](../01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md). Orchestration is concerned with managing the *flow* of work required to handle user interactions and related background processing tasks, especially in a system designed to host multiple, distinctly-scoped Personas.

While the [Ingestion](./ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md) components focus on transforming raw artifacts into usable representations (ephemerally), and [Personas](../02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) focus on analyzing content and generating responses (each operating within its configured boundaries), Orchestration bridges the gap. It coordinates the sequence of events, routes requests based on **activation rules evaluated within the API service (which includes resolving the target `PersonaId`)**, and manages the execution context **by queueing activated tasks (now associated with a specific `PersonaId`) for background workers**.

Key goals of the orchestration layer include:
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring interactions are processed correctly and consistently via the background queue, respecting Persona scopes.
*   **Scalability:** Handling varying loads of concurrent interactions through efficient API activation and **asynchronous processing via Azure Service Bus**, with workers potentially handling tasks for different Personas.
*   **Decoupling & Isolation:** Separating concerns between triggering, activation/routing (which includes Persona resolution), execution (scoped to a Persona), and response delivery. This is crucial for maintaining data isolation between Personas.
*   **Observability:** Providing visibility into the flow of work through the queue and workers, with logs indicating the active Persona for each task.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

The Orchestration layer encompasses several key responsibilities, primarily coordinated by the `Nucleus.Services.Api`:

*   **API Request Handling & Hydration:**
    *   Receiving interaction requests exclusively via the central API endpoint (`POST /api/v1/interactions`), handled by the [`InteractionController.Post`](../../../src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs) method.
    *   Interpreting the incoming `AdapterRequest` DTO and hydrating the initial message context. This includes `TenantId`, `PlatformType`, platform-specific identifiers useful for Persona resolution (e.g., originating bot ID, channel context), and the list of `ArtifactReference` objects pointing to user content in external storage.
    *   Potentially invoking an [`IPersonaResolver`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Orchestration/IPersonaResolver.cs) service early to map platform identifiers or explicit mentions to a canonical Nucleus `PersonaId`, if applicable, to aid routing. This resolver is key to correctly identifying the target Persona.
*   **API Interaction Activation & Routing:**
    *   Determining if an incoming interaction received by the API service warrants processing and for which `PersonaId` based on configured activation rules (e.g., mentions, scope, user, originating bot ID) via [`IActivationChecker`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Orchestration/IActivationChecker.cs) (implemented by [`ActivationChecker`](../../../src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/ActivationChecker.cs)).
    *   If activated for a specific `PersonaId`, **routing the task exclusively to the asynchronous background task queue (`IBackgroundTaskQueue`)** for processing by a worker service. The message enqueued will contain the `TenantId` and resolved `PersonaId`.
    *   This centralized API-based activation (including Persona resolution) and purely asynchronous routing process is fundamental for supporting multiple Personas securely.
    *   **Details:** See [API Activation & Asynchronous Routing](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md).
*   **Interaction Context Creation (Session Initiation):**
    *   *Following successful API activation and Persona resolution, and before queueing*, the API service (specifically its internal orchestration logic) prepares the initial reference message for the queue.
    *   This involves creating the `InteractionId`, gathering necessary context identifiers, packaging the `TenantId` and resolved `PersonaId`, and these references for the **asynchronous handler (background worker)**.
    *   **Details:** See [Session Initiation](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md).
*   **Interaction Lifecycle Management (Executed by Worker, Scoped by Persona):**
    *   Executing the defined steps for processing an interaction *after it has been dequeued by a background worker*. The dequeued message contains the `TenantId` and `PersonaId`.
    *   Hydrating the full `InteractionContext` based on the queued references, including ephemeral content fetching via `IArtifactProvider`. **Crucially, the `IPersonaConfigurationProvider` is used with the `TenantId` and `PersonaId` to load the specific `PersonaConfiguration`, which then dictates the scope of all data access (e.g., knowledge bases, file permissions via `IArtifactProvider`).**
    *   Managing the state of the *individual interaction processing* (e.g., using `PersonaInteractionContext`), ensuring it remains isolated to the active Persona's context.
    *   Coordinating calls to other services like [`IPersonaRuntime`](../../../src/Nucleus.Domain/Personas/Nucleus.Personas.Core/Interfaces/IPersonaRuntime.cs) (passing the specific `PersonaConfiguration`), repositories (ensuring data is written to Persona-specific locations or appropriately partitioned), etc., *within the worker process, always respecting the loaded Persona's scope*.
    *   **Details:** See [Interaction Processing Lifecycle (Activation & Queued Execution)](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md).
*   **State Management:**
    *   Managing any necessary state related to the *flow* of complex or long-running operations (Note: distinct from the ephemeral interaction scratchpad managed within `PersonaInteractionContext`). This state must also be managed in a way that respects Persona and Tenant boundaries.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   Implementing strategies for handling failures during orchestration steps (e.g., retries, compensating actions, logging, alerting).

## 3. Relationship to Other Components

*   **Client Adapters:** Provide initial triggers (`AdapterRequest`) containing only `ArtifactReference` objects. Receive final responses via [`IPlatformNotifier`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Adapters/IPlatformNotifier.cs).
*   **API Endpoint (`/api/v1/interactions`):** The single entry point triggering orchestration.
*   **[`Nucleus.Services.Api`](../../../src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api):** The central hub for receiving interactions, performing activation checks (including Persona resolution), and **queueing activated tasks (scoped with `PersonaId`)** for asynchronous processing using [`IOrchestrationService`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Orchestration/IOrchestrationService.cs) and `IBackgroundTaskQueue`.
*   **Activation Rule Engine:** Logic within the API service that determines if an interaction is relevant.
*   **Internal Task Queue (`IBackgroundTaskQueue`) & Workers (`QueuedInteractionProcessorService`):** The Azure Service Bus queue and the background service(s) responsible for dequeuing reference messages and executing the actual interaction processing logic.
*   **[`PersonaManager`](../../../src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/PersonaManager.cs) Instances:** Components potentially used *by the background worker* to manage the *state* and *lifecycle* of active interaction sessions for specific Personas after dequeuing.
*   **Persona Runtime ([`IPersonaRuntime`](../../../src/Nucleus.Domain/Personas/Nucleus.Personas.Core/Interfaces/IPersonaRuntime.cs)):** Executes domain-specific logic (analysis, query handling) *within the background worker process*.
*   **Artifact Provider ([`IArtifactProvider`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/IArtifactProvider.cs)):** The central interface used by the **background worker** to fetch artifact content based on an `ArtifactReference` received from the queue.
*   **Platform Services ([`IPlatformAttachmentFetcher`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Adapters/IPlatformAttachmentFetcher.cs), [`IPlatformNotifier`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Adapters/IPlatformNotifier.cs)):** Concrete implementations resolved by `IArtifactProvider` or the worker based on `PlatformType`/`ReferenceType` for platform-specific interactions.
*   **Persona Resolver ([`IPersonaResolver`](../../../src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Orchestration/IPersonaResolver.cs)):** Service used *by the API service before queueing* to map between platform identities and canonical Persona IDs.
*   **Persona Profile Store:** Provides the data needed by the `IPersonaResolver` and for looking up target platform identifiers.
*   **Processing Components (Ingestion):** Orchestration *within the worker* invokes necessary ephemeral ingestion/processing steps.
*   **Compute Runtime:** The API service runs in one environment, while the background workers (`QueuedInteractionProcessorService`) run as hosted services (potentially scaled independently).

## 4. Future Considerations

As the system matures (e.g., towards [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#32-workflow-orchestration)), the orchestration layer may evolve to use more sophisticated tools like dedicated workflow engines (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, Dapr Workflows) to handle more complex, stateful, or long-running processes beyond the simple background task model.
