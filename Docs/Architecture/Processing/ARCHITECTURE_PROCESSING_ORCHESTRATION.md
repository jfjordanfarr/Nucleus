# Nucleus OmniRAG: Processing Orchestration Overview

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-16

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Orchestration** sub-domain within the overall [Processing Architecture](../01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md). Orchestration is concerned with managing the *flow* of work required to handle user interactions and related background processing tasks.

While the [Ingestion](./Ingestion/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md) components focus on transforming raw artifacts into usable representations, and [Personas](../02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) focus on analyzing content and generating responses, Orchestration bridges the gap. It coordinates the sequence of events, routes requests to the appropriate context (either existing or new), and manages the execution context, **leveraging dedicated `PersonaManager` components to handle persona-specific session lifecycle and salience checks.**

Key goals of the orchestration layer include:
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring interactions are processed correctly and consistently.
*   **Scalability:** Handling varying loads of concurrent interactions, **facilitated by decentralized session management.**
*   **Decoupling:** Separating concerns between triggering, routing, execution, and response delivery.
*   **Observability:** Providing visibility into the flow of work.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

The Orchestration layer encompasses several key responsibilities:

*   **Request Triggering & Hydration:**
    *   Monitoring triggers (e.g., messages on Pub/Sub subscriptions, API calls).
    *   Interpreting trigger information and hydrating the initial message context (e.g., retrieving user/channel details from the adapter).
*   **Interaction Routing (Salience Check):**
    *   Determining if an incoming message belongs to an *existing* `PersonaInteractionContext`.
    *   **This involves broadcasting the hydrated message to all registered `PersonaManager` instances.** Each `PersonaManager` checks the message's salience against the active sessions *it manages* for its specific Persona type.
    *   The `PersonaManager` whose session claims the message handles further processing for that context.
    *   **Details:** See [Routing & Salience](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md).
*   **New Session Initiation:**
    *   If no existing session claims the message, determining if a *new* `PersonaInteractionContext` should be created.
    *   **This typically involves broadcasting the message again to `PersonaManagers`, asking them to evaluate if they should initiate a new session** based on the message content, user context, or persona activation rules.
    *   The first `PersonaManager` to successfully initiate and register a new context handles the interaction.
    *   **Details:** See [Session Initiation](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md).
*   **Interaction Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Executing the defined steps for processing a single user interaction within its context, from hydration to response generation. (This might be coordinated centrally or delegated further based on the specific step).
    *   **Details:** See [Interaction Processing Lifecycle](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md).
*   **State Management:**
    *   Managing any necessary state related to the *flow* of complex or long-running operations (Note: distinct from the ephemeral interaction scratchpad managed within `PersonaInteractionContext`).
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   Implementing strategies for handling failures during orchestration steps (e.g., retries, compensating actions, logging, alerting).

## 3. Relationship to Other Components

*   **Client Adapters:** Provide initial triggers and context for hydration. Receive final responses for delivery.
*   **Messaging Queues / API Endpoints:** Act as entry points triggering orchestration.
*   **`PersonaManager` Instances:** **Key components managed and coordinated by the central orchestration logic.** Each manager encapsulates session management for a specific Persona type.
*   **Processing Components (Ingestion, Personas):** Orchestration (or the relevant `PersonaManager`/`PersonaInteractionContext`) dispatches work to these components.
*   **Compute Runtime:** The orchestration logic (including the central router and `PersonaManagers`) runs within the chosen compute environment (e.g., ACA).

## 4. Future Considerations

As the system matures (e.g., towards [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#32-workflow-orchestration)), the orchestration layer may evolve to use more sophisticated tools like dedicated workflow engines (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, Dapr Workflows) to handle more complex, stateful, or long-running processes beyond the simple background task model.
