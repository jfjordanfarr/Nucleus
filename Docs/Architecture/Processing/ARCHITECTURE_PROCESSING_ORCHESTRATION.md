# Nucleus OmniRAG: Processing Orchestration Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Orchestration** sub-domain within the overall [Processing Architecture](../05_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md). Orchestration is concerned with managing the *flow* of work required to handle user interactions and related background processing tasks.

While the [Ingestion](./Ingestion/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md) components focus on transforming raw artifacts into usable representations, and [Personas](../02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) focus on analyzing content and generating responses, Orchestration bridges the gap. It coordinates the sequence of events, routes requests based on **platform context and persona profiles**, and manages the execution context, potentially leveraging dedicated `PersonaManager` components to handle persona-specific session lifecycle and salience checks across **multiple platforms**.

Key goals of the orchestration layer include:
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring interactions are processed correctly and consistently.
*   **Scalability:** Handling varying loads of concurrent interactions, **facilitated by decentralized session management.**
*   **Decoupling:** Separating concerns between triggering, routing, execution, and response delivery.
*   **Observability:** Providing visibility into the flow of work.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

The Orchestration layer encompasses several key responsibilities:

*   **Request Triggering & Hydration:**
    *   Monitoring triggers (e.g., messages on Pub/Sub subscriptions, API calls).
    *   Interpreting trigger information (e.g., `NucleusIngestionRequest`) and hydrating the initial message context, **including `PlatformType`, platform-specific user/conversation identifiers, and `ContentSourceUri`.**
    *   Potentially invoking an [`IPersonaResolver`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPersonaResolver.cs:0:0-0:0) service early to map platform identifiers to a canonical Nucleus Persona ID, if applicable, to aid routing.
*   **Interaction Routing (Salience Check):**
    *   Determining if an incoming message (with its associated `PlatformType` and resolved/unresolved Persona ID) belongs to an *existing* `PersonaInteractionContext`.
    *   This involves checking active sessions, possibly coordinated via [`PersonaManager`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/src/ApiService/Nucleus.ApiService/Orchestration/PersonaManager.cs:0:0-0:0) instances which might be responsible for sessions of a specific Persona *across all its supported platforms*.
    *   The component (Orchestrator or specific `PersonaManager`) managing the claiming session handles further processing.
    *   **Details:** See [Routing & Salience](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md).
*   **New Session Initiation:**
    *   If no existing session claims the message, determining which Persona (if any) should handle it and initiate a *new* `PersonaInteractionContext`.
    *   This may involve using the [`IPersonaResolver`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPersonaResolver.cs:0:0-0:0) (if not done during hydration) and checking Persona activation rules based on platform context and message content, potentially coordinated via `PersonaManagers`. **Crucially, a platform-specific key is used for the atomic database claim to prevent duplicates across platforms. This key is constructed by combining the platform type with the platform-specific user or conversation identifier, ensuring uniqueness across different platforms.**
    *   **Details:** See [Session Initiation](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md).
*   **Interaction Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Executing the defined steps for processing an interaction within its context.
    *   **Fetching Original Artifacts:** If a Persona requires the original artifact during `HandleQueryAsync`, the orchestrator uses the **`PlatformType` and `ContentSourceUri` from the *original request*** to resolve and invoke the correct [`IPlatformAttachmentFetcher`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPlatformAttachmentFetcher.cs:0:0-0:0) implementation.
    *   **Sending Responses/Notifications:** When sending messages outwards, the orchestrator determines the target (user or persona) and the **target `PlatformType`** (usually the origin, or specified for persona-to-persona comms). It resolves the correct [`IPlatformNotifier`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPlatformNotifier.cs:0:0-0:0) implementation via DI using this `PlatformType` and uses the Persona Profile (or request context) to get the specific platform identifiers (e.g., Teams User ID, Email Address) needed by the notifier.
    *   Coordinating calls to other services like [`IPersona`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/src/Abstractions/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPersona.cs:0:0-0:0), [`IRepository`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/Data/IRepository.cs:0:0-0:0), [`IChatClient`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IChatClient.cs:0:0-0:0) as needed.
    *   **Details:** See [Interaction Processing Lifecycle](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md).
*   **State Management:**
    *   Managing any necessary state related to the *flow* of complex or long-running operations (Note: distinct from the ephemeral interaction scratchpad managed within `PersonaInteractionContext`).
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   Implementing strategies for handling failures during orchestration steps (e.g., retries, compensating actions, logging, alerting).

## 3. Relationship to Other Components

*   **Client Adapters:** Provide initial triggers (`NucleusIngestionRequest`) and context. Receive final responses via [`IPlatformNotifier`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPlatformNotifier.cs:0:0-0:0).
*   **Messaging Queues / API Endpoints:** Act as entry points triggering orchestration.
*   **[`PersonaManager`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/src/ApiService/Nucleus.ApiService/Orchestration/PersonaManager.cs:0:0-0:0) Instances:** Components potentially used to manage session lifecycles and salience checks for specific Personas across their supported platforms.
*   **Personas ([`IPersona`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/src/Abstractions/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPersona.cs:0:0-0:0)):** Execute domain-specific logic (analysis, query handling).
*   **Platform Services ([`IPlatformAttachmentFetcher`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPlatformAttachmentFetcher.cs:0:0-0:0), [`IPlatformNotifier`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPlatformNotifier.cs:0:0-0:0)):** Resolved by the orchestrator based on `PlatformType` for platform-specific interactions.
*   **Persona Resolver ([`IPersonaResolver`](cci:2://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Nucleus.Abstractions/IPersonaResolver.cs:0:0-0:0)):** Service used to map between platform identities and canonical Persona IDs.
*   **Persona Profile Store:** Provides the data needed by the `IPersonaResolver` and for looking up target platform identifiers.
*   **Processing Components (Ingestion):** Orchestration may trigger ingestion or use its outputs.
*   **Compute Runtime:** The orchestration logic runs within the chosen compute environment.

## 4. Future Considerations

As the system matures (e.g., towards [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#32-workflow-orchestration)), the orchestration layer may evolve to use more sophisticated tools like dedicated workflow engines (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, Dapr Workflows) to handle more complex, stateful, or long-running processes beyond the simple background task model.
