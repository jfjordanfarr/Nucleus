# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational element of the Nucleus architecture, enabling sophisticated interactions between AI models, data sources, and user-facing applications. MCP Tools are a suite of specialized, reusable backend server applications designed to provide discrete, well-defined functionalities that Nucleus M365 Persona Agents can leverage to perform their tasks. These tools abstract complex operations, promote modularity, and ensure consistency in how agents access and process information.

This document provides a high-level overview of the MCP Tools ecosystem within Nucleus, outlining their purpose, key categories, and relationship to the broader system architecture. For detailed specifications of individual tools and their interfaces, please refer to the documents within the respective sub-folders of `McpTools`.

## 1. Core Principles of MCP Tools

MCP Tools are designed with the following principles in mind:

*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Each tool performs a specific function and can be used by multiple M365 Persona Agents across different contexts.
*   **Standardized Interfaces:** Tools expose consistent interfaces (defined by MCP), simplifying integration and allowing for interchangeable implementations where appropriate.
*   **Abstraction:** They hide the underlying complexity of data access, AI model interaction, or specific platform APIs.
*   **Configurability:** Tools can be configured to suit the specific needs of an agent or task.
*   **Testability:** Designed for independent testing, ensuring reliability and robustness.

## 2. Key Nucleus MCP Tools

The Nucleus platform relies on a suite of backend MCP Tool/Server applications to provide specialized functionalities. These tools are consumed by Nucleus M365 Persona Agents.

1.  **`Nucleus_KnowledgeStore_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages all interactions with the Nucleus database (Azure Cosmos DB), including storing and retrieving `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records, and performing vector searches.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./KnowledgeStore/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_KNOWLEDGE_STORE.md`](./KnowledgeStore/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_KNOWLEDGE_STORE.md) for details.

2.  **`Nucleus_FileAccess_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides ephemeral access to file content from various sources (e.g., Microsoft Graph for M365 files, local file system for testing), abstracting the underlying `IArtifactProvider` logic.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./FileAccess/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_FILE_ACCESS.md`](./FileAccess/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_FILE_ACCESS.md) for details.

3.  **`Nucleus_ContentProcessing_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Handles the extraction of textual content from various document formats (e.g., PDF, Office documents) and can synthesize structured Markdown from disparate content components, potentially using LLMs.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./ContentProcessing/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_CONTENT_PROCESSING.md`](./ContentProcessing/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_CONTENT_PROCESSING.md) for details.

4.  **`Nucleus_RAGPipeline_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, including sophisticated search strategies (e.g., hybrid search, 4R ranking) over data in the `Nucleus_KnowledgeStore_McpServer`.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./RAGPipeline/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md`](./RAGPipeline/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md) for details.

5.  **`Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a centralized and standardized interface for Nucleus M365 Persona Agents to interact with various configured Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like chat completion, summarization, and analysis. It manages LLM-specific configurations and API calls.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./LlmOrchestration/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_LLM_ORCHESTRATION.md`](./LlmOrchestration/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_LLM_ORCHESTRATION.md) for details.

6.  **`Nucleus_PersonaBehaviourConfig_McpServer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the dynamic, behavioral aspects of `PersonaConfiguration` (e.g., prompts, response guidelines, custom parameters) stored in Azure Cosmos DB, allowing M365 Persona Agents to adapt their behavior at runtime.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./PersonaBehaviourConfig/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_PERSONA_BEHAVIOUR_CONFIG.md`](./PersonaBehaviourConfig/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_PERSONA_BEHAVIOUR_CONFIG.md) for details.

## 3. Relationship to M365 Agents (Personas)

Nucleus M365 Persona Agents are the primary consumers of these backend MCP Tools. Each agent, driven by its `IPersonaRuntime` and loaded `PersonaConfiguration`, leverages a selection of these MCP Tools to:

*   **Understand Context:** Using tools to access conversation history, shared files, and its own knowledge base.
*   **Process Information:** Employing tools to extract, synthesize, and analyze content.
*   **Generate Responses:** Utilizing tools to interact with LLMs and formulate replies or actions.
*   **Execute Tasks:** Orchestrating multiple tools to perform complex operations.

The MCP Tools provide the building blocks, and the `PersonaConfiguration` and `IPersonaRuntime` logic dictate how these blocks are assembled and utilized to achieve the agent's specific goals and behaviors. This orchestration can involve sophisticated patterns, such as parallel invocations of multiple MCP Tools or iterative calls based on evolving context, enabling advanced reasoning strategies like "Cognitive Forking" within the M365 Agent.

## 4. Extensibility

The MCP Tools ecosystem is designed to be extensible. New tools can be developed and integrated into the Nucleus platform to support emerging AI capabilities, new data sources, or specialized functionalities required by future M365 Persona Agents. This ensures that Nucleus can adapt and grow as the AI landscape evolves.
