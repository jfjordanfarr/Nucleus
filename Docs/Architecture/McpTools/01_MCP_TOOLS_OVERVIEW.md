# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational element of the Nucleus architecture, enabling sophisticated interactions between AI models, data sources, and user-facing applications. MCP Tools are a suite of specialized, reusable components designed to provide discrete, well-defined functionalities that M365 Agents (Personas) can leverage to perform their tasks. These tools abstract complex operations, promote modularity, and ensure consistency in how Personas access and process information.

This document provides a high-level overview of the MCP Tools ecosystem within Nucleus, outlining their purpose, key categories, and relationship to the broader system architecture. For detailed specifications of individual tools and their interfaces, please refer to the documents within the `McpTools` sub-folder.

## 1. Core Principles of MCP Tools

MCP Tools are designed with the following principles in mind:

*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Each tool performs a specific function and can be used by multiple Personas across different contexts.
*   **Standardized Interfaces:** Tools expose consistent interfaces, simplifying integration and allowing for interchangeable implementations where appropriate.
*   **Abstraction:** They hide the underlying complexity of data access, AI model interaction, or specific platform APIs.
*   **Configurability:** Tools can be configured to suit the specific needs of a Persona or task.
*   **Testability:** Designed for independent testing, ensuring reliability and robustness.

## 2. Key Categories of MCP Tools

While the suite of MCP Tools will evolve, they generally fall into the following categories:

### 2.1. Data Access & Management Tools

These tools provide controlled access to various data sources and manage the flow of information.

*   **Knowledge Store Access Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Facilitates querying and retrieving information from the Nucleus Knowledge Store (Cosmos DB with vector search).
    *   **Functionality:** Handles semantic search, metadata filtering, and retrieval of `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` objects.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./02_MCP_TOOL_KNOWLEDGE_STORE_ACCESS.md`](./02_MCP_TOOL_KNOWLEDGE_STORE_ACCESS.md) for details.
*   **Platform File Access Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables Personas to access files shared within the context of integrated platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) using platform-specific APIs and permissions.
    *   **Functionality:** Abstracts platform-specific file fetching mechanisms, respecting user permissions and data sovereignty.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./03_MCP_TOOL_PLATFORM_FILE_ACCESS.md`](./03_MCP_TOOL_PLATFORM_FILE_ACCESS.md) for details.
*   **External Data Source Tools (Future):**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide access to data from external repositories (e.g., SharePoint, Google Drive, Confluence) via user-authorized connections.
    *   **Functionality:** Will handle OAuth flows and API interactions for specific external services.

### 2.2. Content Processing & Analysis Tools

These tools are responsible for transforming raw content into structured, analyzable information.

*   **Content Extraction Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Extracts text and relevant metadata from various file formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, PPTX, MSG).
    *   **Functionality:** Leverages libraries and techniques for robust content parsing.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./04_MCP_TOOL_CONTENT_EXTRACTION.md`](./04_MCP_TOOL_CONTENT_EXTRACTION.md) for details.
*   **Content Synthesis & Summarization Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Uses AI models to synthesize information, generate summaries, or extract key insights from processed content.
    *   **Functionality:** Interacts with the configured AI inference provider (e.g., Google Gemini) using persona-defined prompts.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./05_MCP_TOOL_CONTENT_SYNTHESIS.md`](./05_MCP_TOOL_CONTENT_SYNTHESIS.md) for details.
*   **PII Detection & Redaction Tool (Conceptual):**
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies and optionally redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from content before further processing or storage, aligning with Nucleus's security and privacy principles.
    *   **Functionality:** May use pattern matching, NLP techniques, or specialized AI services.

### 2.3. AI Orchestration & Interaction Tools

These tools manage the interaction with AI models and orchestrate complex agentic behaviors.

*   **LLM Orchestration Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages calls to Large Language Models (LLMs), including prompt engineering, context window management, and response parsing.
    *   **Functionality:** Provides a standardized way for Personas to interact with different AI models and configurations.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./06_MCP_TOOL_LLM_ORCHESTRATION.md`](./06_MCP_TOOL_LLM_ORCHESTRATION.md) for details.
*   **RAG Pipeline Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, combining retrieved knowledge with LLM capabilities to generate informed responses.
    *   **Functionality:** Orchestrates calls to the Knowledge Store Access Tool and the LLM Orchestration Tool.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./07_MCP_TOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md`](./07_MCP_TOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md) for details.
*   **Tool Use Orchestration Tool (Agentic Capabilities):**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables Personas to select and use other MCP Tools dynamically based on the task requirements (akin to function calling in LLMs).
    *   **Functionality:** Manages the lifecycle of tool calls, parameter passing, and result aggregation.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./08_MCP_TOOL_AGENTIC_ORCHESTRATION.md`](./08_MCP_TOOL_AGENTIC_ORCHESTRATION.md) for details.

### 2.4. Persona & Behavior Management Tools

These tools allow for the definition and management of Persona-specific behaviors and configurations.

*   **Persona Configuration Access Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides access to a Persona's configuration settings, including prompts, salience rules, and tool preferences.
    *   **Functionality:** Loads and caches Persona configuration data.
    *   **Reference:** See [`../CoreNucleus/02_PERSONA_CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md`](../CoreNucleus/02_PERSONA_CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md).
*   **Salience Engine Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** Determines if an incoming event (e.g., message, file share) is relevant to a particular Persona based on its configured salience rules.
    *   **Functionality:** Evaluates event data against Persona-specific criteria.
    *   **Reference:** See [`./09_MCP_TOOL_SALIENCE_ENGINE.md`](./09_MCP_TOOL_SALIENCE_ENGINE.md) for details.

## 3. Relationship to M365 Agents (Personas)

M365 Agents (Personas) are the primary consumers of MCP Tools. Each Persona, defined by its `IPersona` implementation and associated configuration, leverages a selection of MCP Tools to:

*   **Understand Context:** Using tools to access conversation history, shared files, and its own knowledge base.
*   **Process Information:** Employing tools to extract, synthesize, and analyze content.
*   **Generate Responses:** Utilizing tools to interact with LLMs and formulate replies or actions.
*   **Execute Tasks:** Orchestrating multiple tools to perform complex operations.

The MCP Tools provide the building blocks, and the Persona definition dictates how these blocks are assembled and utilized to achieve the Persona's specific goals and behaviors.

## 4. Extensibility

The MCP Tools ecosystem is designed to be extensible. New tools can be developed and integrated into the Nucleus platform to support emerging AI capabilities, new data sources, or specialized functionalities required by future Personas. This ensures that Nucleus can adapt and grow as the AI landscape evolves.
