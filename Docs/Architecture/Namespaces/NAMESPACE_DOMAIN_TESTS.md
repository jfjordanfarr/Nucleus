# Namespace: `Nucleus.Domain.Tests`

## 1. Overview

The `Nucleus.Domain.Tests` project contains unit tests specifically targeting the components within the `Nucleus.Domain` layer of the application. This includes projects like `Nucleus.Domain.Processing` and `Nucleus.Personas.Core`.

The primary goal of this project is to ensure the correctness and reliability of individual units of business logic, services, and domain entities in isolation.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

*   **Purpose:** To verify the functional correctness of domain layer components through automated unit tests.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Testing public methods of services and classes within the `Nucleus.Domain.*` namespaces.
    *   Focusing on business logic, state transitions, and interactions between domain objects.
    *   Mocking external dependencies (e.g., repositories, infrastructure services, other domain services not under direct test) to ensure tests are isolated and fast.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Integration testing (covered by projects in `tests/Integration/`).
    *   End-to-end testing.
    *   Testing private methods directly (these should be tested via their public contract).

## 3. Project Structure

*   **Location:** `tests/Unit/Nucleus.Domain.Tests/`
*   **Test Framework:** xUnit.net
*   **Mocking Framework:** Moq (or a similar framework, as appropriate)
*   **Organization:** Test files are typically named after the class they are testing, with a `Tests` suffix (e.g., `QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs`). Tests within these files are organized by the method being tested and the scenario under test.

## 4. Key Components & Test Targets

This project will initially focus on, but not be limited to, testing components such as:

*   `QueuedInteractionProcessorService` (from `Nucleus.Domain.Processing`)
    *   Message processing lifecycle.
    *   Interaction with `IPersonaRuntime`.
    *   Interaction with `IPlatformNotifier`.
    *   Error handling and message abandonment logic.
*   Persona-related services and logic from `Nucleus.Personas.Core`.
*   Other domain services and entities as they are developed.

## 5. Dependencies

*   **Production Code:**
    *   `Nucleus.Domain.Processing` (and other `Nucleus.Domain.*` projects as needed)
    *   `Nucleus.Abstractions` (for shared interfaces and DTOs)
*   **Test Infrastructure:**
    *   `Nucleus.Infrastructure.Testing` (for shared test doubles, mocks, fakes, and test helper utilities)
*   **Test Frameworks:**
    *   xUnit.net
    *   Moq (or equivalent)
