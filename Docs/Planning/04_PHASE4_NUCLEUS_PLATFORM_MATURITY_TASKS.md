## `ISSUE-P4-ORCHESTRATION-01`: Robust Asynchronous Processing & Job Management

*Primary Location: `Nucleus.Services.Api`, `Nucleus.Adapters.M365Agent`, potentially a new `Nucleus.WorkerService`*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-QUEUE-01:** Implement a robust message queue (e.g., Azure Service Bus) for offloading long-running tasks from the M365 Agent or API (e.g., complex analysis, batch processing, summarization of large documents).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-WORKER-01:** Develop a separate worker service (`Nucleus.WorkerService`) to process messages from the queue.
    *   This service will host persona logic, LLM calls, and data persistence for asynchronous jobs.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-AGENT-ASYNC-01:** M365 Agent: When a task is offloaded:
    *   Send an immediate acknowledgment to the user in Teams.
    *   Implement a mechanism for the agent to proactively send a message to the user in Teams once the background task is complete (e.g., using Bot Framework proactive messaging based on saved conversation references).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-API-JOB-STATUS-01:** `Nucleus.Services.Api`: Implement API endpoints for querying job status if needed (e.g., `/api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/status`).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-RETRY-01:** Implement retry mechanisms and dead-lettering for message queue processing.

## `ISSUE-P4-ADMIN-UI-01`: Develop Admin User Interface

*Primary Location: New project `Nucleus.Web.AdminPortal` (e.g., Blazor WebAssembly or MVC)*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-PROJ-01:** Initialize new project for the Admin UI.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-AUTH-01:** Implement authentication for the Admin UI (e.g., Entra ID based).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-CONFIG-01:** UI for viewing and managing system configuration (e.g., persona settings, LLM provider details - read-only for sensitive data, feature flags).
    *   Requires corresponding API endpoints in `Nucleus.Services.Api` to expose/update configuration.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-MONITOR-01:** UI for viewing system health, basic metrics, and logs (potentially embedding Application Insights dashboards or querying logs via API).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-JOBS-01:** UI for viewing and managing asynchronous job statuses (if applicable).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-USERS-01:** UI for managing users/tenants if multi-tenancy is implemented (e.g., viewing their data, managing persona assignments).

## `ISSUE-P4-SECURITY-HARDEN-01`: Comprehensive Security Hardening

*Primary Location: All services, Infrastructure, CI/CD*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-AUDIT-01:** Conduct a full security audit of the platform (threat modeling, penetration testing if budget allows).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-DEVOPS-01:** Implement DevSecOps practices: static code analysis (SAST), dynamic code analysis (DAST), dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-RBAC-01:** Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all API endpoints and Admin UI functionalities.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-DATA-01:** Review and implement data encryption at rest (Cosmos DB default) and in transit (HTTPS default). Ensure PII handling aligns with privacy policies.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-INPUT-01:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding across all services to prevent common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi - though NoSQL, injection still a concern).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-THROTTLING-01:** Implement rate limiting and throttling for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

## `ISSUE-P4-PERF-SCALE-01`: Performance Optimization & Scalability Testing

*Primary Location: All services, Aspire AppHost, Azure Infrastructure*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-TEST-01:** Conduct comprehensive load testing to identify bottlenecks under various scenarios (high user concurrency, large data processing).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-OPTIMIZE-01:** Optimize database queries (Cosmos DB indexing, RU provisioning), LLM calls (prompt optimization, batching if possible), and service response times based on testing.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-CACHE-01:** Implement and optimize caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., persona configurations, popular knowledge entries) using Azure Cache for Redis or similar.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SCALE-CONFIG-01:** Configure auto-scaling for all Azure services (App Services, Functions, Cosmos DB RU/s, Service Bus) based on performance metrics.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SCALE-REGION-01:** Plan for multi-region deployment if high availability and disaster recovery are critical requirements (may be deferred based on complexity).

## `ISSUE-P4-DOCS-OSS-01`: Finalize Documentation & Prepare for Open Source / Wider Release

*Primary Location: `Docs/` repository, GitHub project*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-DOCS-USER-01:** Create comprehensive user documentation for end-users interacting with the M365 Agent.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-DOCS-ADMIN-01:** Create detailed documentation for administrators using the Admin UI and managing the platform.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-DOCS-DEV-01:** Ensure all developer documentation (architecture, setup, contribution guidelines) is up-to-date and complete.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-DOCS-API-01:** Generate API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI for `Nucleus.Services.Api`).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-OSS-LICENSE-01:** Confirm and finalize open-source licensing (e.g., MIT License).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-OSS-CONTRIB-01:** Establish clear contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and issue templates for community involvement.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-OSS-RELEASE-01:** Prepare a stable release build with versioning.

## `ISSUE-P4-TELEMETRY-UX-01`: Advanced Telemetry & UX Refinement

*Primary Location: `Nucleus.Adapters.M365Agent`, `Nucleus.Services.Api`, Admin UI*

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-TELEMETRY-UX-01:** Implement detailed telemetry for user interactions within the M365 Agent to understand feature usage, common pain points, and areas for improvement.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-TELEMETRY-UX-02:** Analyze telemetry data to identify opportunities for UX refinement in the M365 Agent and Admin UI.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-UX-FEEDBACK-01:** Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback directly through the M365 Agent or Admin UI.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-UX-ITERATE-01:** Iterate on agent responses, card designs, and Admin UI workflows based on telemetry and user feedback.
