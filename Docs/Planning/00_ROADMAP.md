# Nucleus OmniRAG - Development Phases (Epic -> Issue Outline)

This document outlines the planned development phases for Nucleus OmniRAG, structured similarly to JIRA Epics and Issues. It aligns with the requirements defined in `docs/Requirements/`.

---

## Phase 1: MVP - Core API Foundation & Initial Validation

**Epic:** `EPIC-MVP-API` - Establish the minimum viable **API service (`Nucleus.ApiService`)** and backend infrastructure. Prioritize building the core API endpoints, integrating the initial persona, setting up basic knowledge storage (Cosmos DB), and validating these components using an **initial reference client (e.g., `Nucleus.Console`)**. Set up foundational architecture and deployment infrastructure (Azure, IaC) for the API.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-SETUP-01`: Establish Core Project Structure & Local Environment
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-PROCESS-01`: Develop Basic Content Extraction (Foundation for Ingestion)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-PERSONA-01`: Create Initial Bootstrapper Persona
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-API-01`: Develop Backend API (Core Endpoints: Query, Ingest, Status)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-CONSOLE-01`: Create Minimal Console Client Interface (for API Validation)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-INFRA-01`: Define Basic Infrastructure (as Code for API)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-RETRIEVAL-01`: Implement Basic Knowledge Store & Retrieval

## Phase 2: Multi-Platform Integration

**Epic:** `EPIC-MULTI-PLATFORM` - Expand ingestion and interaction capabilities beyond the basic chat UI. Implement adapters for key communication platforms: **Email**, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Discord. Enable querying and interaction through these platforms.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-INGEST-00-EMAIL`: Implement Email Ingestion Adapter
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-INGEST-01`: Implement Teams Ingestion Adapter
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-INGEST-02`: Implement Slack Ingestion Adapter
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-INGEST-03`: Implement Discord Ingestion Adapter
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-PROCESS-01`: Enhance content extraction for platform-specific message formats (Markdown variants, attachments)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-QUERY-01`: Integrate query capabilities directly into Teams (Bot Command/Message Extension)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-QUERY-02`: Integrate query capabilities directly into Slack (Slash Command/Bot)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-QUERY-03`: Integrate query capabilities directly into Discord (Slash Command/Bot)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-UI-01`: Update Web App UI to distinguish between different content sources
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-AUTH-01`: Implement OAuth or platform-specific authentication for adapters

## Phase 3: Enhancements & Sophistication

**Epic:** `EPIC-ENHANCEMENTS` - Improve persona capabilities, user experience, and system flexibility.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PERSONA-01`: Develop more sophisticated Personas (e.g., `EduFlow`, `CodeCompanion`)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PROCESS-01`: Implement advanced metadata extraction (e.g., entities, keywords) during processing
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PROCESS-02`: Refine the `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` schema based on persona needs
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-QUERY-01`: Enhance query service with filtering by source, date, persona, metadata
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-UI-01`: Improve Web App UI with richer result display, filtering options, and basic persona management
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-CONFIG-01`: Implement robust configuration management for personas and ingestion sources
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-CACHE-01`: Implement the `ICacheManagementService` and integrate LLM provider caching (e.g., Gemini)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-TEST-01`: Establish initial automated testing framework (Unit, Integration)

## Phase 4: Maturity & Optimization

**Epic:** `EPIC-MATURITY` - Focus on reliability, scalability, security, observability, and performance.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-OBSERV-01`: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring (Application Insights)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-ERROR-01`: Enhance error handling and resilience across all services
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-SEC-01`: Conduct security review and implement hardening measures (Input validation, dependency scanning, secure configuration)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-PERF-01`: Performance analysis and optimization of ingestion, processing, and query paths
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-SCALE-01`: Review and optimize Azure resource configurations for scalability
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-QUERY-01`: Implement advanced query features (e.g., hybrid search, re-ranking)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-ADMIN-01`: Develop basic administrative functions (e.g., user management if needed, system health dashboard)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-DOCS-01`: Improve internal and potentially external developer/user documentation
