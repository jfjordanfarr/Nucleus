# Nucleus - Development Phases (Epic -> Issue Outline)

This document outlines the planned development phases for Nucleus, structured similarly to JIRA Epics and Issues. It aligns with the requirements defined in `docs/Requirements/`.

---

## Phase 1: MVP - Core API Foundation & Initial Validation

**Epic:** `EPIC-MVP-API` - Establish the minimum viable **API service (`Nucleus.ApiService`)** and backend infrastructure. Prioritize building the core **unified interaction API endpoint (`/api/v1/interactions`)**, integrating the initial persona, setting up basic metadata storage (Cosmos DB), and validating these components through **internal integration (e.g., using `Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local`) and direct API testing**. Set up foundational architecture and deployment infrastructure (Azure, IaC) for the API.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-SETUP-01`: Establish Core Project Structure & Local Environment
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-PROCESS-01`: Develop Basic Content Extraction (Used by API on ephemeral content)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-PERSONA-01`: Create Initial Bootstrapper Persona
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-API-01`: Develop Backend API (Unified Interaction Endpoint: `/api/v1/interactions`, Status Endpoint)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-INFRA-01`: Define Basic Infrastructure (as Code for API)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MVP-RETRIEVAL-01`: Implement Basic Metadata Store (`ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) & Retrieval Foundation

## Phase 2: Multi-Platform Integration

**Epic:** `EPIC-MULTI-PLATFORM` - Implement client adapters for key communication platforms: Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Discord. Enable querying and interaction through these platforms via the unified API endpoint, with adapters passing platform-specific `ArtifactReference` objects. Enhance API to use `IArtifactProvider` implementations for ephemeral content retrieval.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-ADAPT-TEAMS-01`: Implement Teams Client Adapter (Passes Graph `ArtifactReference`)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-ADAPT-SLACK-01`: Implement Slack Client Adapter (Passes Slack file `ArtifactReference`)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-ADAPT-DISCORD-01`: Implement Discord Client Adapter (Passes attachment `ArtifactReference`)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-API-01`: Enhance API (`/interactions`) to handle platform `ArtifactReference` & invoke `IArtifactProvider`.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-PROVIDER-01`: Implement `IArtifactProvider` interface and concrete providers (Teams, Slack, etc.).
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-PROCESS-01`: Enhance content extraction (within API) for diverse formats from ephemeral content.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MP-AUTH-01`: Implement secure handling of credentials needed by API's `IArtifactProvider` implementations (e.g., Graph API secrets).

## Phase 3: Enhancements & Sophistication

**Epic:** `EPIC-ENHANCEMENTS` - Improve persona capabilities (**agentic processing using ephemeral context**), implement the **4 R ranking system** for retrieval, enhance metadata extraction, and add caching/configuration/testing.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PERSONA-01`: Develop more sophisticated Personas (agentic processing)
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PROCESS-01`: Implement advanced metadata extraction (Entities, Keywords, Richness) during API processing.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-PROCESS-02`: Refine Metadata/Knowledge schemas for advanced needs & ranking.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-QUERY-01`: Enhance retrieval service with filtering and implement **4 R Ranking**.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-UI-01`: (Low Priority) Improve any Admin UI with richer result display, filtering options, and basic persona management
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-CONFIG-01`: Implement robust configuration management.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-CACHE-01`: Implement `ICacheManagementService` and integrate caching.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-ENH-TEST-01`: Establish automated testing framework (Unit, Integration, API).

## Phase 4: Maturity & Optimization

**Epic:** `EPIC-MATURITY` - Focus on reliability, scalability, security, observability, performance, **workflow orchestration**, and **richer bot interactions**.

*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-OBSERV-01`: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-ERROR-01`: Enhance error handling and resilience.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-SEC-01`: Conduct security review and implement hardening measures.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-PERF-01`: Performance analysis and optimization.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-SCALE-01`: Review and optimize Azure resource configurations for scalability.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-QUERY-01`: Implement advanced query features (e.g., hybrid search, leveraging 4R ranking results).
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-ADMIN-01`: Develop administrative functions (API/UI).
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-DOCS-01`: Improve internal and potentially external developer/user documentation.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-ORCH-01`: Implement Workflow Orchestration (e.g., Durable Functions) for complex tasks.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-BOT-UI-01`: Implement Enhanced Platform Bot Interactions (Adaptive Cards, etc.).
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-BACKUP-01`: Define & Test Backup/Recovery for Metadata DB.
*   **Issue:** `ISSUE-MAT-DEPLOY-01`: Comprehensive Deployment Automation.
