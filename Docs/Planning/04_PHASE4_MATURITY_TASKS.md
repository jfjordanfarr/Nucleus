# Phase 4: Maturity & Orchestration Tasks

**Epic:** [`EPIC-MATURITY`](./00_ROADMAP.md#phase-4-maturity--orchestration)
**Requirements:** [`04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md`](../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md)

This document details the specific tasks required to complete Phase 4.

---

## `ISSUE-MAT-ORCH-01`: Implement Robust Job Orchestration (within ApiService or dedicated Orchestration Service)

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-01:** Choose orchestration technology (e.g., Azure Functions with Durable Functions, Azure Logic Apps, Service Bus queues with worker roles).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-02:** Design orchestration workflow for handling **asynchronous interactions** initiated via `POST /api/v1/interactions`:
    *   Triggered by API endpoint when synchronous response is not feasible.
    *   Manage state transitions (Queued, Processing, RetrievingContent, Analyzing, StoringMetadata, Completed, Failed).
    *   Handle retries and error handling for each step (content retrieval via `IArtifactProvider`, metadata extraction, persona invocation, metadata storage).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-03:** Implement the chosen orchestration workflow.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-04:** Integrate the orchestrator with the `Nucleus.Services.Api` (e.g., API enqueues job, orchestrator calls API/service logic for steps).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-05:** Ensure the `GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/status` endpoint reads status from the orchestrator or a shared state store updated by the orchestrator.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ORCH-06:** Implement notification mechanism (e.g., webhook calls) from the orchestrator to client adapters upon job completion/failure.

## `ISSUE-MAT-MONITOR-01`: Enhance Monitoring and Logging

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-MON-01:** Integrate Application Insights (or chosen APM tool) across all services (`Nucleus.Services.Api`, Adapters, Infrastructure components, Orchestrator).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-MON-02:** Implement structured logging throughout the pipeline:
    *   Include Correlation IDs linking requests from adapter -> API -> orchestrator -> underlying services.
    *   Log key events: Interaction received, `ArtifactReference` processing initiated, `IArtifactProvider` invoked, Content retrieved (metadata only!), Extraction started/completed, Persona invoked, Metadata stored, Job status changes, Errors.
    *   **Crucially:** Ensure NO sensitive ephemeral content is logged.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-MON-03:** Set up dashboards in APM tool for key metrics (request latency, error rates, job throughput, queue lengths, dependency health - Cosmos DB, LLM, cache).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-MON-04:** Configure alerts for critical failures (high error rates, unresponsive dependencies, orchestration failures).

## `ISSUE-MAT-SECURITY-01`: Security Hardening & Compliance

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-01:** Conduct security review of the entire architecture, focusing on:
    *   **Zero Trust adherence:** Confirm no user content leakage into logs, databases, or intermediate storage.
    *   Authentication/Authorization mechanisms (Adapter -> API, API -> internal services, `IArtifactProvider` -> platform APIs).
    *   Secure credential management (Key Vault usage for all secrets/keys used by Adapters and `ApiService`/`IArtifactProvider`s).
    *   Input validation and output encoding (API endpoints, adapter interactions).
    *   Dependency vulnerability scanning.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-02:** Implement Rate Limiting on API endpoints.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-03:** Implement comprehensive Input Validation for all API DTOs and adapter inputs.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-04:** Harden infrastructure configurations (network security groups, firewall rules, minimal permissions).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-05:** Review and document compliance requirements (if applicable, e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and ensure controls are in place (data residency, access controls, audit logs).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-SEC-06:** Plan for regular security audits and penetration testing.

## `ISSUE-MAT-PERF-01`: Performance Tuning & Scalability

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-01:** Conduct load testing scenarios simulating realistic usage patterns (concurrent interactions, large ephemeral content retrieval, complex agentic processing).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-02:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks based on load testing and monitoring data:
    *   API endpoint response times.
    *   Orchestration job processing times.
    *   Database query performance (Cosmos DB RU/s, indexing for 4R ranking).
    *   LLM provider latency and throughput.
    *   Ephemeral content retrieval latency via `IArtifactProvider`s (network, platform API limits).
    *   CPU/Memory usage of services.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-03:** Optimize database usage (indexing strategies, query optimization, appropriate consistency levels).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-04:** Optimize caching strategies (cache hit rates, TTLs).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-05:** Configure auto-scaling for services based on load (e.g., Azure App Service plans, AKS node pools, Functions consumption plan).
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-PERF-06:** Optimize LLM usage (prompt engineering, potential model tier selection).

## `ISSUE-MAT-ADMIN-01`: Enhance Admin Capabilities

*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-01:** Enhance Admin UI (if applicable) with features for monitoring job status, viewing logs (correlation ID based), managing configuration, potentially viewing aggregated/anonymized usage metrics.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-02:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin UI/API.
*   [ ] **TASK-P4-ADMIN-03:** Provide tools for troubleshooting common issues (e.g., re-triggering failed jobs, clearing specific cache entries).
