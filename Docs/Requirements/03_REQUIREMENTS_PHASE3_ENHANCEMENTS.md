# Requirements: Phase 3 - Backend Enhancements & Advanced Personas

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Goal

To significantly enhance the Nucleus OmniRAG platform's backend capabilities by implementing advanced persona logic, improving query mechanisms, introducing caching and robust configuration, and establishing a solid testing foundation.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Implementation of sophisticated, specific Personas (e.g., `EduFlow`, `CodeCompanion`).
    *   Enhancements to `IPersona` capabilities (e.g., stateful processing, tool use - potentially requiring orchestration later).
    *   Implementation of advanced RAG/query strategies in the backend API (filtering, synthesis).
    *   Implementation of caching mechanisms.
    *   Establishment of robust configuration management.
    *   Setup of automated testing frameworks (Unit, Integration).
*   **Secondary Focus (Stretch Goals/Potential Scope):**
    *   Richer bot interactions using platform-specific UI elements (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands) - *Deferred to Phase 4*. 
    *   Introduction of orchestration for complex persona workflows (e.g., Durable Functions) - *Deferred to Phase 4*.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the multi-platform bot integration established in Phase 2 ([02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md](./02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Advanced Querying & Retrieval (Backend API & Services)

*   **REQ-P3-API-001:** The `Nucleus.Api` project MUST expose secure endpoints for clients (Console App, Platform Bots) to perform queries.
*   **REQ-P3-API-002:** The `IRetrievalService` implementation MUST be enhanced to support more sophisticated query strategies beyond basic vector similarity search (e.g., hybrid search, re-ranking, filtering by metadata like source platform or time).
*   **REQ-P3-API-003:** The backend MUST support queries that potentially synthesize information from multiple `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents to answer complex user questions.
*   **REQ-P3-API-004:** Query responses MUST include sufficient metadata for clients to display results with clear source attribution.

### 3.2. Advanced Persona Capabilities

*   **REQ-P3-PER-001:** The `IPersona` interface and/or its implementations SHOULD be enhanced to support more complex analysis tasks. Examples include:
    *   **Stateful Processing:** Ability for a persona to maintain state across multiple interactions or processing steps for a single artifact (potentially requiring orchestration later - *See Phase 4*).
    *   **Tool Use:** Ability for a persona to invoke predefined tools (internal or external APIs) as part of its analysis process (leveraging AI model function calling capabilities).
    *   **Refined Structured Output:** Generating more complex or nested structured data based on analysis.
*   **REQ-P3-PER-002:** Personas SHOULD be configurable with more detailed instructions or operational parameters (potentially via Admin UI or configuration files - *Admin UI targeted for Phase 4*).

### 3.3. Caching Implementation

*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-001:** An `ICacheManagementService` interface MUST be defined.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-002:** An implementation targeting a suitable caching mechanism (e.g., Gemini API Cache, in-memory for local, potentially external later) MUST be created.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-003:** Caching logic MUST be integrated into relevant parts of the system (e.g., `IPersona` implementations) to reduce redundant computations or API calls where appropriate.

### 3.4. Configuration Management

*   **REQ-P3-CONF-001:** Configuration schemas for personas, ingestion sources, and other key components MUST be defined.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-002:** Configuration MUST be loaded using standard `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` patterns.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-003:** Sensitive configuration values MUST be handled securely (e.g., via Key Vault integration).

### 3.5. Automated Testing Framework

*   **REQ-P3-TEST-001:** Unit test projects MUST be established for key components.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-002:** Integration test project MUST be established.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-003:** Mechanisms for emulating dependencies (e.g., Testcontainers for Cosmos DB) MUST be integrated for integration tests.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-004:** Initial unit and integration tests covering core functionalities MUST be implemented.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-005:** Test execution MUST be integrated into the CI pipeline.

### 3.6. (Optional) Enhanced Platform Integration

*   **REQ-P3-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MAY be enhanced to utilize richer UI elements for displaying results or handling interactions (e.g., displaying analysis results in an Adaptive Card with actions, using Slack Block Kit for interactive elements, implementing Discord Slash Commands for specific actions). - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***
*   **REQ-P3-BOT-002:** Bots MAY support more conversational flows for clarifying queries or guiding users. - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***

### 3.7. (Optional) Orchestration

*   **REQ-P3-ORC-001:** For complex, multi-step, or long-running persona analysis workflows, an orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, potentially via `Nucleus.Orchestrations` project) MAY be implemented to manage state and execution flow. - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***

## 4. Non-Goals (Phase 3)

*   User-facing Web Application.
*   Full implementation of Workflow Orchestration (focus is on backend processing enhancements).
*   Full implementation of Rich Bot Interactions (focus is on backend processing enhancements).
*   Integrating *new* communication platforms beyond Email, Teams, Discord, Slack.
*   Significant Admin UI development (basic configuration APIs are in scope, but full UI is Phase 4).
