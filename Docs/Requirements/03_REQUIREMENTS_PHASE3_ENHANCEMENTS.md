# Requirements: Phase 3 - Enhancements & Web Application

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Goal

To significantly enhance the Nucleus OmniRAG platform by introducing a user-facing Web Application (Blazor WASM) for centralized interaction and knowledge browsing, implementing advanced persona capabilities, improving query mechanisms, and potentially adding richer platform-specific bot interactions.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Development of a functional Web Application frontend.
    *   Implementation of advanced RAG/query strategies in the backend API.
    *   Enhancements to `IPersona` capabilities (e.g., stateful processing, tool use).
*   **Secondary Focus (Stretch Goals/Potential Scope):**
    *   Richer bot interactions using platform-specific UI elements (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands).
    *   Introduction of orchestration for complex persona workflows (e.g., Durable Functions).
    *   Expanded Admin UI/API features.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the multi-platform bot integration established in Phase 2 ([02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md](./02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Web Application (Blazor WASM Frontend)

*   **REQ-P3-WEB-001:** A dedicated Web Application MUST be developed using Blazor WASM.
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-002:** Users MUST be able to securely authenticate to the Web App (e.g., using Microsoft Entra ID or another configurable OIDC provider).
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-003:** Authenticated users MUST be able to view a list or dashboard of artifacts they have submitted or have access to (potentially filtered by source platform or persona).
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-004:** Users MUST be able to view the `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` details associated with processed artifacts (analysis summaries, relevant snippets).
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-005:** Users MUST be able to perform direct queries against their accessible knowledge base via a search/query interface in the Web App.
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-006:** The Web App MUST display query results, clearly citing source artifacts/snippets.
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-007:** (Optional) The Web App MAY allow users to manually upload new artifacts for processing.
*   **REQ-P3-WEB-008:** (Optional) The Web App MAY provide basic user profile/settings management.

### 3.2. Advanced Querying & Retrieval (Backend API & Services)

*   **REQ-P3-API-001:** The `Nucleus.Api` project MUST expose secure endpoints for the Web App to perform queries.
*   **REQ-P3-API-002:** The `IRetrievalService` implementation MUST be enhanced to support more sophisticated query strategies beyond basic vector similarity search (e.g., hybrid search, re-ranking, filtering by metadata like source platform or time).
*   **REQ-P3-API-003:** The backend MUST support queries that potentially synthesize information from multiple `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents to answer complex user questions.
*   **REQ-P3-API-004:** Query responses MUST include sufficient metadata for the frontend to display results with clear source attribution.

### 3.3. Advanced Persona Capabilities

*   **REQ-P3-PER-001:** The `IPersona` interface and/or its implementations SHOULD be enhanced to support more complex analysis tasks. Examples include:
    *   **Stateful Processing:** Ability for a persona to maintain state across multiple interactions or processing steps for a single artifact (potentially requiring orchestration - REQ-P3-ORC-001).
    *   **Tool Use:** Ability for a persona to invoke predefined tools (internal or external APIs) as part of its analysis process (leveraging AI model function calling capabilities).
    *   **Refined Structured Output:** Generating more complex or nested structured data based on analysis.
*   **REQ-P3-PER-002:** Personas SHOULD be configurable with more detailed instructions or operational parameters (potentially via Admin UI or configuration files).

### 3.4. (Optional) Enhanced Platform Integration

*   **REQ-P3-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MAY be enhanced to utilize richer UI elements for displaying results or handling interactions (e.g., displaying analysis results in an Adaptive Card with actions, using Slack Block Kit for interactive elements, implementing Discord Slash Commands for specific actions).
*   **REQ-P3-BOT-002:** Bots MAY support more conversational flows for clarifying queries or guiding users.

### 3.5. (Optional) Orchestration

*   **REQ-P3-ORC-001:** For complex, multi-step, or long-running persona analysis workflows, an orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, potentially via `Nucleus.Orchestrations` project) MAY be implemented to manage state and execution flow.

### 3.6. (Optional) Enterprise Readiness & Management

*   **REQ-P3-ADM-001:** The Admin UI/API MAY be expanded to include features like user management, more detailed system monitoring, or advanced persona configuration.
*   **REQ-P3-ADM-002:** Deployment automation scripts (Bicep/Terraform) SHOULD be created or enhanced (`infra/` project).

## 4. Non-Goals (Phase 3)

*   Full offline capabilities for the Web App.
*   Real-time collaborative features within the Web App.
*   Integrating *new* communication platforms beyond Email, Teams, Discord, Slack.
