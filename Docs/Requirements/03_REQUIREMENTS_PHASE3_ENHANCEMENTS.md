# Requirements: Phase 3 - API Enhancements & Advanced Personas

**Version:** 1.3
**Date:** 2025-04-27

## 1. Goal

To significantly enhance the Nucleus platform's backend capabilities, primarily within the `Nucleus.Services.Api`, by implementing advanced agentic persona logic, improving query mechanisms (including the 4 R ranking system), introducing caching and robust configuration, and establishing a solid testing foundation.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Implementation of sophisticated, specific Personas (e.g., `EduFlow`, `CodeCompanion`).
    *   Enhancements to `IPersona` capabilities (e.g., stateful processing, tool use - potentially requiring orchestration later).
    *   Implementation of advanced RAG/query strategies in the backend API (filtering, synthesis).
    *   Implementation of caching mechanisms.
    *   Establishment of robust configuration management.
    *   Setup of automated testing frameworks (Unit, Integration).
*   **Secondary Focus (Stretch Goals/Potential Scope):**
    *   Richer bot interactions using platform-specific UI elements (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands) - *Deferred to Phase 4*. 
    *   Introduction of orchestration for complex persona workflows (e.g., Durable Functions) - *Deferred to Phase 4*.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the multi-platform bot integration established in Phase 2 ([02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md](./02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Advanced Querying & Retrieval (Backend API & Services)

*   **REQ-P3-API-001:** The `Nucleus.Services.Api` project MUST expose secure endpoints through which *all* client interactions (Console App, Platform Bots) flow for performing queries via the unified `/api/v1/interactions` endpoint.
*   **REQ-P3-API-002:** The `IRetrievalService` implementation MUST be enhanced to support more sophisticated query strategies beyond basic vector similarity search, including:
    *   Hybrid search (combining vector and keyword/metadata search).
    *   Metadata filtering (e.g., source platform, time range, artifact type).
    *   Re-ranking of initial candidates using the **4 R Ranking System (Recency, Relevancy, Richness, Reputation)** to prioritize artifacts for ephemeral context retrieval.
*   **REQ-P3-API-003:** The backend persona processing MUST support synthesizing information from multiple sources to answer complex user questions. This synthesis relies on:
    *   Structured knowledge retrieved from `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records.
    *   Rich contextual understanding derived from the **ephemerally fetched full content** of the top-ranked source artifacts (identified by `REQ-P3-API-002` and retrieved via `IArtifactProvider`).
*   **REQ-P3-API-004:** Query responses MUST include sufficient metadata (e.g., `ArtifactReference` identifiers) for clients to display results with clear source attribution, enabling features like "Show Your Work".

### 3.2. Advanced Persona Capabilities

*   **REQ-P3-PER-001:** The `IPersona` interface and/or its implementations MUST be enhanced to support **agentic processing patterns** involving potentially multiple steps of reasoning and action based on the retrieved structured knowledge and ephemeral context. Examples include:
    *   **Internal State:** Ability for a persona to maintain internal state *during* a single complex interaction or analysis task.
    *   **Tool Use Logic:** Ability for a persona's internal logic to determine when to invoke predefined tools (internal services like `IRetrievalService` again, or external APIs via dedicated providers) as part of its analysis process, potentially leveraging AI model function calling capabilities.
    *   **Refined Structured Output:** Generating more complex or nested structured data (e.g., `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` updates, analysis reports) based on the agentic processing.
    *(Note: While Phase 3 implements the core agentic logic within personas, complex multi-turn conversations or long-running, stateful workflows requiring external orchestration are deferred to Phase 4)*.
*   **REQ-P3-PER-002:** Personas SHOULD be configurable with more detailed instructions or operational parameters (potentially via Admin UI or configuration files - *Admin UI targeted for Phase 4*).

### 3.3. Caching Implementation

*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-001:** An `ICacheManagementService` interface MUST be defined.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-002:** An implementation targeting a suitable caching mechanism (e.g., Gemini API Cache, in-memory for local, potentially external later) MUST be created.
*   **REQ-P3-CACHE-003:** Caching logic MUST be integrated into relevant parts of the system (e.g., `IPersona` implementations) to reduce redundant computations or API calls where appropriate.

### 3.4. Configuration Management

*   **REQ-P3-CONF-001:** Configuration schemas for personas, ingestion sources, and other key components MUST be defined.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-002:** Configuration MUST be loaded using standard `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` patterns.
*   **REQ-P3-CONF-003:** Sensitive configuration values MUST be handled securely (e.g., via Key Vault integration).

### 3.5. Automated Testing Framework

*   **REQ-P3-TEST-001:** Unit test projects MUST be established for key components.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-002:** Integration test project MUST be established.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-003:** Mechanisms for emulating dependencies (e.g., Testcontainers for Cosmos DB) MUST be integrated for integration tests.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-004:** Initial unit and integration tests covering core functionalities MUST be implemented.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-005:** Test execution MUST be integrated into the CI pipeline.
*   **REQ-P3-TEST-006:** Testing strategies MUST prioritize direct interaction with the `Nucleus.Services.Api` endpoints (e.g., using `HttpClient` in test projects) to validate API contracts and behavior, including scenarios involving `ArtifactReference` objects and simulated `IArtifactProvider` responses.

### 3.6. (Optional) Enhanced Platform Integration

*   **REQ-P3-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MAY be enhanced to utilize richer UI elements for displaying results or handling interactions (e.g., displaying analysis results in an Adaptive Card with actions, using Slack Block Kit for interactive elements, implementing Discord Slash Commands for specific actions). - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***
*   **REQ-P3-BOT-002:** Bots MAY support more conversational flows for clarifying queries or guiding users. - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***

### 3.7. (Optional) Orchestration

*   **REQ-P3-ORC-001:** For complex, multi-step, or long-running persona analysis workflows, an orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, potentially via `Nucleus.Orchestrations` project) MAY be implemented to manage state and execution flow. - ***DEFERRED TO PHASE 4***

## 4. Non-Goals (Phase 3)

*   User-facing Web Application.
*   Full implementation of external Workflow Orchestration engines (e.g., Durable Functions) for long-running stateful tasks.
*   Full implementation of Rich Bot Interactions (e.g., Adaptive Cards) beyond basic responses.
*   Integrating *new* communication platforms beyond Email, Teams, Discord, Slack.
*   Significant Admin UI development (basic configuration APIs are in scope, but full UI is Phase 4).
