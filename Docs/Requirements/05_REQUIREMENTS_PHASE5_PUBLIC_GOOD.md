# Requirements: Phase 5 - Public Knowledge Repository ("Public Good")

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Goal

To establish a trusted, publicly accessible repository of high-quality, AI-generated insights and knowledge snippets, curated and contributed by the Nucleus OmniRAG user community. This "Public Good" repository aims to democratize access to valuable, vetted information derived from diverse sources, fostering collective intelligence and learning.

## 2. Scope

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Implementing the storage and indexing infrastructure for the public knowledge repository.
    *   Finalizing and operationalizing the workflow for users to contribute content and for administrators/moderators to vet and approve submissions.
    *   Providing mechanisms for users (across Nucleus instances or via a public interface) to search, retrieve, and potentially cite knowledge from the public repository.
    *   Establishing clear attribution and licensing for contributed content.
*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Developing discovery features (e.g., browsing by topic, trending insights).
    *   Exploring incentive models for contribution.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the preparatory work, user interfaces, and administrative tools developed in Phase 4 ([04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md](./04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Public Knowledge Repository Infrastructure

*   **REQ-P5-INF-001:** A dedicated, scalable storage mechanism MUST be implemented for the Public Knowledge Repository (e.g., a separate Cosmos DB database/container, a distinct search index).
*   **REQ-P5-INF-002:** The repository MUST store vetted `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data (or a transformed public representation), including the analysis/snippet, embeddings, relevant metadata (e.g., source type, original persona), and attribution information.
*   **REQ-P5-INF-003:** The repository MUST be indexed effectively to support efficient search and retrieval based on semantic similarity and metadata filters.
*   **REQ-P5-INF-004:** Access controls MUST ensure that only vetted, approved content resides in the public repository and that underlying private source data remains inaccessible.

### 3.2. Contribution & Vetting Workflow

*   **REQ-P5-WF-001:** The user interface (likely the Web App) MUST provide a clear and intuitive way for users to nominate specific `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` items generated within their private Nucleus instance for contribution to the Public Repository.
*   **REQ-P5-WF-002:** Users nominating content MUST agree to the terms of contribution, including licensing (e.g., Creative Commons) and attribution.
*   **REQ-P5-WF-003:** An automated vetting pipeline MUST be executed upon nomination, performing checks for:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    *   Potentially sensitive or confidential information patterns.
    *   Compliance with content safety policies (e.g., toxicity, hate speech).
*   **REQ-P5-WF-004:** An administrative interface (Admin UI) MUST allow designated reviewers/moderators to review nominated entries that pass automated checks.
*   **REQ-P5-WF-005:** Reviewers MUST be able to approve or reject submissions based on quality, relevance, safety, and adherence to guidelines.
*   **REQ-P5-WF-006:** Upon approval, the relevant knowledge entry (or its public representation) MUST be copied/moved to the Public Knowledge Repository with appropriate metadata (status set to "Public", attribution linked).
*   **REQ-P5-WF-007:** Clear notifications MUST be provided to the contributing user regarding the status of their nomination (Pending Review, Approved, Rejected).

### 3.3. Public Access & Discovery

*   **REQ-P5-ACC-001:** A mechanism MUST exist for users to query the Public Knowledge Repository. This could be:
    *   An option within the existing Nucleus Web App query interface (e.g., a checkbox "Include Public Knowledge").
    *   A dedicated public-facing search portal (potentially read-only).
    *   An API endpoint for other Nucleus instances or third-party applications (subject to access policies).
*   **REQ-P5-ACC-002:** Search results retrieved from the Public Repository MUST be clearly distinguishable from private results.
*   **REQ-P5-ACC-003:** Retrieved public knowledge entries MUST display clear attribution to the original contributor (e.g., username/alias, contribution date) and the applicable license.
*   **REQ-P5-ACC-004:** (Optional) Discovery features MAY be implemented, such as browsing public knowledge by topic/category, viewing recently added or popular entries.

### 3.4. Governance, Attribution & Licensing

*   **REQ-P5-GOV-001:** Clear contribution guidelines and content policies MUST be established and communicated to users.
*   **REQ-P5-GOV-002:** A standard license (e.g., a specific Creative Commons license) MUST be chosen for all content contributed to the Public Repository.
*   **REQ-P5-GOV-003:** A persistent and reliable method for attributing contributions MUST be implemented.
*   **REQ-P5-GOV-004:** Moderation tools and processes MUST be available for managing the Public Repository, including handling disputes, removing problematic content, and potentially banning users from contributing.

### 3.5. (Optional) Incentives & Gamification

*   **REQ-P5-INC-001:** Mechanisms MAY be explored to incentivize high-quality contributions, such as:
    *   Leaderboards for top contributors.
    *   Badges or reputation scores within the Web App.
    *   (Speculative) Potential links to micropayments or other value-exchange systems if deemed appropriate and feasible.

## 4. Non-Goals (Phase 5)

*   Replacing existing private Nucleus instances; the Public Repository is supplementary.
*   Allowing anonymous contributions (attribution is key).
*   Guaranteeing real-time synchronization between private instances and the public repository.
