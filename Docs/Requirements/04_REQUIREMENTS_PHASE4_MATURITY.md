# Requirements: Platform Maturity & Operational Excellence

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-25

## 1. Goal

To mature the Nucleus platform into an enterprise-grade system by enhancing operational excellence, refining interactions for **Microsoft 365 Agents** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients**, implementing robust workflow orchestration for complex tasks, and providing comprehensive administrative, security, and deployment features. This phase ensures the platform is scalable, manageable, secure, and ready for diverse operational scenarios.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus (Platform Maturation):**
    *   **Enhanced M365 Agent / MCP Client Interactions:** Implementing richer, more interactive experiences within M365 host applications (e.g., using Adaptive Cards in Teams/Outlook) and for MCP clients, driven by Nucleus backend capabilities.
    *   **Workflow Orchestration:** Utilizing Azure Durable Functions (or similar, via `Nucleus.Orchestrations`) for managing complex, stateful, long-running, or multi-step tasks initiated by M365 Agents or MCP tool calls.
    *   **Advanced Admin API & UI Features:** Developing comprehensive administrative capabilities for system monitoring, configuration management (personas, security policies), user/access control (if applicable beyond M365), logging, and auditing. (Admin UI might be a separate web app or integrated into an existing M365 admin experience if feasible).
    *   **Security Hardening & Compliance:** Implementing advanced security measures, data protection policies, and features to support compliance with relevant standards.
    *   **Deployment Automation & Operational Procedures:** Establishing fully automated deployment pipelines (IaC with Bicep/Terraform), comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and well-defined operational procedures (backup, recovery, scaling).
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the advanced backend capabilities and M365/MCP integration established in previous phases ([`03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Enhanced M365 Agent / MCP Client Interactions

*   **REQ-MAT-UX-001:** Nucleus, when responding to M365 Agents, MUST be capable of generating rich, interactive outputs suitable for rendering as Adaptive Cards or other native M365 UI elements. This includes structured data, action buttons, and input fields.
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-002:** The backend (e.g., `Nucleus.Services.McpServer` or an M365 integration layer) MUST be able to handle callbacks and actions initiated from these rich UI elements (e.g., button clicks in an Adaptive Card triggering a subsequent MCP tool call or M365 Agent action).
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-003:** For MCP clients, Nucleus tools SHOULD provide clear schemas for inputs and outputs that allow clients to build rich UIs if desired. Nucleus MAY provide guidance or reference implementations for rendering its tool outputs effectively.
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-004:** Conversational flows initiated by M365 Agents SHOULD feel more natural and guided, with Personas capable of clarifying ambiguous requests or prompting for necessary information using M365-native interaction patterns.

### 3.2. Workflow Orchestration (for M365/MCP)

*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-001:** A robust orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions within `Nucleus.Orchestrations`) MUST manage complex, stateful, or long-running tasks initiated via M365 Agent requests or MCP tool calls.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-002:** Asynchronous tasks identified in previous phases (e.g., extensive document analysis) MUST be refactored to leverage this orchestration engine, allowing for better state management, error handling, and visibility.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-003:** The orchestration framework MUST support patterns like fan-out/fan-in for parallel processing (e.g., multiple analysis facets on a document), long-running timers, and human interaction steps (if applicable through M365 Agent prompts).
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-004:** Status of orchestrated workflows MUST be queryable via an API endpoint (e.g., for M365 Agents to provide updates to users or for admin monitoring).
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-005:** Orchestrations MUST implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms (with backoff), and compensation logic where appropriate.

### 3.3. Enterprise Readiness & Admin Features

*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-001:** A dedicated Admin API (within `Nucleus.Services.Api` or a new `Nucleus.Services.AdminApi`) MUST provide endpoints for comprehensive system management. A corresponding Admin UI (web application) SHOULD be developed to consume this API.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-002 (Monitoring & Logging):** Administrators MUST be able to:
    *   View aggregated system logs (from all services, including M365 integration points and MCP Server).
    *   Monitor the health, performance (latency, throughput, error rates), and resource utilization of all Nucleus backend services (Azure App Services, Functions, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Cache).
    *   Configure alerts for critical system events or performance degradation.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-003 (Persona Management):** Administrators MUST be able to:
    *   View and manage registered Nucleus Personas.
    *   Configure persona-specific parameters, prompts, and operational settings (e.g., access to specific tools/data, rate limits).
    *   Enable/disable Personas for M365 Agent discovery or MCP listing.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-004 (Configuration Management):** Administrators MUST be able to manage non-sensitive application settings and view current configurations (sensitive values should remain in Key Vault but their presence/status might be indicated).
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-005 (Tenant Management - for Multi-Tenant Cloud-Hosted):** If the cloud-hosted Nucleus supports multiple tenants, administrators MUST have tools to manage tenant lifecycles, resource isolation (if applicable), and view tenant-specific usage/analytics.

### 3.4. Security, Compliance & Governance

*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-001 (Data Protection):** Implement robust data protection measures for data at rest (Cosmos DB, Cache) and in transit, including encryption and access controls. Adhere to principles of least privilege.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-002 (Audit Trails):** Comprehensive audit trails MUST be implemented for significant system events, administrative actions, and data access/modification (where appropriate and respecting privacy). Logs should be securely stored and tamper-evident.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-003 (Identity & Access Management):** Integrate with Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) for administrative access to the Nucleus backend and Admin UI. M365 Agent interactions will rely on the M365 identity and permission model.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-004 (Compliance):** The platform design SHOULD consider common compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2) and facilitate adherence where applicable, particularly for data handling and security practices.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-005 (Vulnerability Management):** Regular security assessments, penetration testing, and a process for addressing identified vulnerabilities MUST be established.

### 3.5. Deployment & Operations

*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-001 (Automated Deployments):** Fully automated CI/CD pipelines MUST be implemented for deploying all Nucleus components (backend services, MCP Server, Admin UI, infrastructure changes) to Azure environments (dev, staging, prod).
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-002 (Infrastructure as Code):** All Azure infrastructure MUST be managed using IaC (Bicep or Terraform), stored in version control, and deployed through the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-003 (Scalability & Resilience):** Backend services MUST be designed and configured for scalability (e.g., auto-scaling rules for App Services/Functions) and high availability (e.g., zone-redundant configurations for critical services like Cosmos DB, Service Bus).
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-004 (Backup & Recovery):** Automated backup procedures for critical data stores (Cosmos DB metadata, configuration) MUST be in place. Disaster recovery plans and procedures MUST be documented and periodically tested.
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-005 (Operational Monitoring & Alerting):** Comprehensive operational monitoring (extending REQ-MAT-ADM-002) with automated alerting for critical issues MUST be established to ensure proactive issue detection and resolution.

## 4. Non-Goals (This Phase)

*   Introducing new core AI functionalities beyond refining existing Persona capabilities and their orchestration.
*   Expanding to fundamentally new third-party platform integrations outside the M365 ecosystem or generic MCP clients.

## 5. Key Dependencies & Linkages

*   **Microsoft 365 Developer Platform:** For Adaptive Cards, M365 Agent capabilities, and admin integration points.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification:** For ensuring continued interoperability.
*   **Azure Services:** Deep reliance on Azure for hosting, orchestration (Durable Functions), database (Cosmos DB), messaging (Service Bus), caching, monitoring (Application Insights), security (Key Vault, Entra ID), and deployment (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions).
*   **Previous Requirements Documents:** This phase builds upon all preceding requirements, particularly those for M365/MCP integration and advanced backend services.
*   **Architecture Documents:** All relevant Nucleus architecture documents.
