# Requirements: Phase 4 - Platform Maturity & Orchestration

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** 2025-04-27

## 1. Goal

To mature the Nucleus platform by enhancing the user experience within integrated chat platforms (Teams, Discord, Slack) through richer interactions, implementing robust workflow orchestration for complex tasks, and adding key enterprise management and deployment features.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Implementing advanced UI interactions within platform bots (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands).
    *   Introducing workflow orchestration (e.g., Azure Durable Functions) for stateful or multi-step persona processing.
    *   Developing enhanced Admin UI/API features for management and monitoring.
    *   Automating deployment processes.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the Web Application and enhanced backend capabilities developed in Phase 3 ([03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Enhanced Platform Bot Interactions

*   **REQ-P4-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MUST be enhanced to utilize richer, platform-specific UI elements for presenting information and enabling user actions. Examples:
    *   **Teams:** Use Adaptive Cards to display structured analysis results, status updates with action buttons (e.g., "Show Snippets", "Cancel Job").
    *   **Slack:** Use Block Kit elements for interactive messages, buttons, select menus for configuration or feedback.
    *   **Discord:** Use Embeds for formatted results, Buttons, and potentially Slash Commands for invoking specific persona actions (e.g., `/analyze`, `/query`, `/status`).
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-002:** Bots SHOULD support more natural conversational flows for clarifying user requests or guiding interactions, potentially maintaining limited short-term context within a conversation.
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-003:** The system (specifically the adapters) MUST handle callbacks and interactions originating from these richer UI elements (e.g., button clicks, menu selections). *(Note: This often involves the adapter making calls back to the `Nucleus.Services.Api` to fulfill the requested action).*

### 3.2. Workflow Orchestration

*   **REQ-P4-ORC-001:** An orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions via `Nucleus.Orchestrations`) MUST be implemented to manage complex, stateful, long-running, or multi-step persona analysis workflows.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-002:** The existing asynchronous processing trigger (message queue) SHOULD initiate orchestration instances instead of directly invoking the full analysis pipeline in a single function execution for tasks deemed complex.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-003:** The orchestration framework MUST reliably manage state between steps (e.g., content extraction -> parallel analysis by multiple personas -> aggregation -> notification).
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-004:** The status query API endpoint (defined in P2/P3) MUST be updated to retrieve status information from active orchestration instances, providing a unified status view.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-005:** Orchestrations MUST handle failures and retries gracefully within the workflow definition.

### 3.3. Enterprise Readiness & Admin Features

*   **REQ-P4-ADM-001:** An Admin UI/API MUST be significantly expanded to provide administrative oversight and control. Implementation involves expanding the `Nucleus.Services.Api` with dedicated admin endpoints and MAY involve a dedicated web interface or leverage platform-native UIs interacting with those endpoints.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-002:** Administrators MUST be able to view detailed system logs and monitor the health and performance of backend services (Adapters, Orchestrations, API, Database) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-003:** Administrators MUST be able to manage users and permissions/roles within the Nucleus system (if applicable beyond relying solely on platform permissions) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-004:** Administrators MUST have finer-grained control over Persona configuration (e.g., enabling/disabling personas, setting resource limits, configuring prompts/behavior parameters) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-005:** Comprehensive deployment automation scripts (Bicep/Terraform) MUST be created and maintained (`infra/` project) to enable repeatable deployments of the entire Nucleus stack (Azure resources, application code) for both Cloud-Hosted and Self-Hosted scenarios.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-006:** Backup and recovery strategies for the system's persistent **metadata database** (e.g., Cosmos DB) and any **temporary file storage** used during processing MUST be defined and tested. This explicitly **excludes** backing up original user file content, which remains in user-controlled storage per Zero Trust principles.
