# Requirements: Phase 4 - Platform Maturity & Orchestration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Goal

To mature the Nucleus OmniRAG platform by enhancing the user experience within integrated chat platforms (Teams, Discord, Slack) through richer interactions, implementing robust workflow orchestration for complex tasks, and adding key enterprise management and deployment features.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Implementing advanced UI interactions within platform bots (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands).
    *   Introducing workflow orchestration (e.g., Azure Durable Functions) for stateful or multi-step persona processing.
    *   Developing enhanced Admin UI/API features for management and monitoring.
    *   Automating deployment processes.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the Web Application and enhanced backend capabilities developed in Phase 3 ([03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Enhanced Platform Bot Interactions

*   **REQ-P4-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MUST be enhanced to utilize richer, platform-specific UI elements for presenting information and enabling user actions. Examples:
    *   **Teams:** Use Adaptive Cards to display structured analysis results, status updates with action buttons (e.g., "Show Snippets", "Cancel Job").
    *   **Slack:** Use Block Kit elements for interactive messages, buttons, select menus for configuration or feedback.
    *   **Discord:** Use Embeds for formatted results, Buttons, and potentially Slash Commands for invoking specific persona actions (e.g., `/analyze`, `/query`, `/status`).
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-002:** Bots SHOULD support more natural conversational flows for clarifying user requests or guiding interactions, potentially maintaining limited short-term context within a conversation.
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-003:** The system MUST handle callbacks and interactions originating from these richer UI elements (e.g., button clicks, menu selections).

### 3.2. Workflow Orchestration

*   **REQ-P4-ORC-001:** An orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions via `Nucleus.Orchestrations`) MUST be implemented to manage complex, stateful, long-running, or multi-step persona analysis workflows.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-002:** The existing asynchronous processing trigger (message queue) SHOULD initiate orchestration instances instead of directly invoking the full analysis pipeline in a single function execution for tasks deemed complex.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-003:** The orchestration framework MUST reliably manage state between steps (e.g., content extraction -> parallel analysis by multiple personas -> aggregation -> notification).
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-004:** The status query mechanism (REQ-P2-USR-006) MUST be updated to retrieve status information from active orchestration instances.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-005:** Orchestrations MUST handle failures and retries gracefully within the workflow definition.

### 3.3. Enterprise Readiness & Admin Features

*   **REQ-P4-ADM-001:** The Admin UI/API (potentially part of the Phase 3 Web App or a separate portal) MUST be significantly expanded.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-002:** Administrators MUST be able to view detailed system logs and monitor the health and performance of backend services (Adapters, Processing Functions, API, Database, Queue).
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-003:** Administrators MUST be able to manage users and permissions/roles within the Nucleus system (if applicable beyond relying solely on platform permissions).
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-004:** Administrators MUST have finer-grained control over Persona configuration (e.g., enabling/disabling personas, setting resource limits, configuring prompts/behavior parameters).
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-005:** Comprehensive deployment automation scripts (Bicep/Terraform) MUST be created and maintained (`infra/` project) to enable repeatable deployments of the entire Nucleus stack (Azure resources, application code) for both Cloud-Hosted and Self-Hosted scenarios.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-006:** Backup and recovery strategies for the database and file storage MUST be defined and tested.

### 3.4. Foundational Work for Phase 5 ("Public Good")

*   **REQ-P4-PUB-001:** Mechanisms SHOULD be explored or implemented for users (perhaps via the Web App) to nominate or flag specific `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` items as potentially suitable for wider sharing.
*   **REQ-P4-PUB-002:** A process or workflow SHOULD be designed for vetting nominated knowledge entries (e.g., automated PII checks, manual review queues accessible via Admin UI) before they are marked as "publicly shareable".
*   **REQ-P4-PUB-003:** The data model (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry` or a related entity) SHOULD accommodate metadata indicating the sharing status (e.g., Private, Nominated, Vetted/Public).

## 4. Non-Goals (Phase 4)

*   Full implementation of the Phase 5 "Public Good" knowledge sharing system (Phase 4 focuses on preparatory work).
*   Adding fundamentally new core capabilities beyond enhancing existing ones (e.g., no new communication platforms, no radically different AI model integrations unless required for orchestration/tool use).
