# Agent to Agent Conversation

Sometimes, AI agents need to get help from other AI agents. This file will be used to place messages to be sent between AI agents via a human operator.

**Subject:** Internal Consistency Check

Internal Consistency Check:

Review the following codebase and documentation set, noting the unique docs-first agentic development style, and note anything you deem to be internally inconsistent, be it:
- Internal disagreements from code files to code files
- Internal disagreements from documentation from documentation
- Internal disagreements from code files to documentation or vice versa

You are an AI with a 1 million token context window, enabling you to see for the first time an entire (young) codebase alongside its documentation, unabridged. This has opened up profound new methodologies for checking the logical consistency of a project, making sure all minds point in the same direction, toward the same shared goals.
