## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Overall Task Definition

The primary goal is to resolve all CodeQL scan warnings and unit test failures in the Nucleus project. This includes addressing "Log entries created from user input" (completed by refactoring to `SanitizeLogInput`), new "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" warnings (assessed as likely false positives), and fixing unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests.cs` (completed). CI pipeline issues like test log permissions (addressed) and logger creation patterns are also being refined.

## 3. Current Task & Sub-Tasks

**Current Focus:** Address PR comment on logger creation in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` and provide advice on CodeQL branch protection issues.

*   **Overall Progress:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Resolve runtime DI errors in `Nucleus.AppHost`.
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Verify application startup.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Initial manual fix for CodeQL "Log entries created from user input" warnings.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Confirm CodeQL "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings are in non-executable example files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Create `StringExtensions.cs` with `SanitizeLogInput` method.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** Implement global usings for `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Abstractions.Utils`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Refactor all identified files to use `SanitizeLogInput` extension method.
    8.  **COMPLETED:** Fix CI pipeline test results path for TRX logger.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Address CI pipeline `System.UnauthorizedAccessException` for `/unit_test_diag.log` by adding a directory creation step.
    10. **COMPLETED:** Investigate and fix 9 unit test failures in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs` by correcting `IActionResult` types in `InteractionController.cs`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Investigate CodeQL warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` and `LocalAdapter.cs`. Assessed as likely false positives due to safe handling of data.
    12. **NEW (IN PROGRESS):** Address PR comment in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` regarding logger creation pattern.
    13. **NEW (IN PROGRESS):** Provide advice on CodeQL branch protection rule blocking merges due to past commits.
    14. **PENDING:** User review and approval of all changes.
    15. **PENDING:** User re-run CodeQL scan and tests in CI to confirm all fixes.

*   **Detailed Sub-Tasks (Current Focus):**
    *   **`ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` Refactoring:**
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Read `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Modify logger creation to use `AddLogging` and resolve `ILoggerFactory` as per PR comment.
    *   **CodeQL Branch Protection Advice:**
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Formulate advice on investigating and resolving the CodeQL merge block.

## 4. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Turn Summary:** Addressed unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests.cs` by modifying `InteractionController.cs`. Addressed CI log permission issue in `pr-validation.yml`. Assessed new CodeQL warnings as likely false positives.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Corrected `IActionResult` return types in `InteractionController` to match test expectations.
    *   Added `mkdir` step in CI workflow for test results diagnostic log path.
    *   Determined CodeQL "User-controlled bypass" warnings were likely false positives based on code logic.
*   **Search/Analysis Results:**
    *   Unit tests for `InteractionControllerTests.cs` passed after controller modifications.
*   **Pending User Feedback/Actions:**
    *   Review and approve all subsequent changes.
    *   Re-run CodeQL scan and tests in CI to confirm all fixes.
    *   Investigate CodeQL merge blocking issue based on advice to be provided.

## 5. Current Contextual Information

*   **User Instructions:** Adhere to Nucleus project mandate, quality over expedience, documentation as source code, context/cross-checking, persona-centric design, and core principles.
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (target for refactoring)
    *   GitHub repository settings and CodeQL workflow (relevant for advice)
*   **PR Comment to Address:** Refactor logger creation in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` to avoid temporary service provider and use `ILoggerFactory`.
*   **CodeQL Issue:** Merging blocked due to CodeQL expecting results for past commits (e.g., `2d6dbc1`, `ef6603f`).

## 6. Agent's Scratchpad & Next Steps

1.  **Current Step:** Update this session state document.
2.  **Next Step:** Read `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Messaging/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
3.  **Then:** Apply suggested refactoring to logger creation in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
4.  **Then:** Provide advice on the CodeQL branch protection issue.
5.  **Future Steps:**
    *   Await user review and CI re-run.
