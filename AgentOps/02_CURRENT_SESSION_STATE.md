## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues and finalize GitHub Actions workflows.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`).
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update workflow files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Manage project branches.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** User set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Updated workflows to use `ci_tests` environment.
    8.  **COMPLETED:** Resolved local build issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Resolved Git branch divergence on `develop`.
    10. **COMPLETED:** User merged `main` (with new `codeql.yml` and updated `pr-validation.yml`) into `develop`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Corrected the MSB9008 build failure for `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj` by changing its reference in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` from `../../../../src/...` to `../../../src/...`.
    12. **COMPLETED:** Resolved MSB9008 build error in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` by correcting `ProjectReference` paths. User confirmed `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` now pass locally.
    13. **NEW (Current Focus):** CodeQL analysis is blocking PR merge to `main` because it's expecting results for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, but `codeql.yml` is only configured for C#.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   User successfully rebased local `develop` on `origin/develop` and pushed changes.
    *   CI pipeline build step passed, but `dotnet format` failed (subsequently removed by user).
    *   Agent modified `pr-validation.yml` to target integration test `.csproj` directly, resolving `dotnet test` failures.
    *   Agent fixed `if` condition for `sast_scan` (CodeQL) job in `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   CodeQL `autobuild` failed due to .NET SDK version mismatch (resolved by user adding `setup-dotnet`).
    *   CodeQL `analyze` failed due to conflict with default setup.
    *   User opted for a dedicated custom CodeQL workflow (`codeql.yml`, initially `codeql-analysis.yml`).
    *   Agent provided YAML for `codeql.yml` targeting `develop` and `main` branches for C#.
    *   Agent removed the old `sast_scan` job from `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   User committed `codeql.yml` to `main` and then merged `main` into `develop`.
    *   An MSB9008 error in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` was resolved by correcting `ProjectReference` paths.
    *   User confirmed local build and tests are passing.
    *   **User reported that a PR to `main` is blocked because CodeQL is expecting JavaScript/TypeScript and Python scan results.**

*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Project uses `develop` for integration, `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests controlled by `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED`.
    *   Environment Secrets used for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`.
    *   `dotnet format` step removed from CI.
    *   Target specific test `.csproj` files for `dotnet test` in CI.
    *   Use a dedicated custom CodeQL workflow (`codeql.yml`) instead of the `sast_scan` job in `pr-validation.yml` or GitHub's default setup.
    *   The `codeql.yml` file is configured for .NET 9 and C# analysis.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Modify `codeql.yml` to include basic CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python to unblock PR merges to `main`.
*   **Pending Actions:**
    1.  **AGENT ACTION (In Progress):** Research correct CodeQL configurations for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.
    2.  **AGENT ACTION:** Propose modifications to `codeql.yml`.
    3.  **AGENT ACTION (If approved):** Apply the changes using `insert_edit_into_file`.
    4.  **USER ACTION:** Commit and push the updated `codeql.yml` to the PR branch.
    5.  **TEST & VERIFY:**
        *   Confirm the CodeQL workflow runs on the PR.
        *   Confirm all expected CodeQL analyses (C#, JS/TS, Python) complete successfully.
        *   Confirm the PR to `main` is unblocked.
    6.  **IN DISCUSSION (post-fix):** Evaluate if SAST is needed in `release.yml`.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** User is working on a PR branch targeting `main`.
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   PR to `main` is blocked due to missing CodeQL scan results for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User values quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User prefers their established coding style and has removed automated formatting from CI.
*   User wants to ensure SAST (CodeQL) is functioning correctly and comprehensively for configured languages.

## 8. Next Steps (Post-Fix)

1.  After the `codeql.yml` fix is pushed and verified:
    *   Confirm PR to `main` can be merged.
2.  Discuss SAST for `release.yml`.
