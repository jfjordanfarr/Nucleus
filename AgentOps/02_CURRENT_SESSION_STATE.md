## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues and finalize GitHub Actions workflows.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`). (Build passed, but formatting/linting failed in CI)
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests (with `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` set to `false` for now) and uses simplified test filters.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing in workflows, deciding on Environment Secrets.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update the necessary workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Manage project branches: Stashed changes on `Dev`, checked out `main`, applied stash, created `develop` from `main`, and deleted `Dev`.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** User has set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests` with the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` secret.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Updated workflow files (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`) to use the `ci_tests` environment.
    8.  **COMPLETED (Locally):** Resolved build issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` by correcting project reference paths (to relative) and removing conflicting explicit package references, relying on transitive dependencies from `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj`. Local `Debug` and `Release` builds and tests are now succeeding.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Resolved Git branch divergence on `develop` by having user `git pull --rebase origin develop` and then `git push origin develop`.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   User successfully rebased local `develop` on `origin/develop` and pushed changes.
    *   CI pipeline build step passed, but the `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` step failed.
    *   User committed `icon.png` to the repository root.
    *   User removed the `dotnet format` step from `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   Agent modified `pr-validation.yml` to target the integration test `.csproj` directly and added `--diag` flags to test steps. This resolved the `dotnet test` failures.
    *   User reported that the SAST (CodeQL) step was being skipped. Agent incorrectly attempted to add new CodeQL steps.
    *   Agent correctly modified the `if` condition for the existing `sast_scan` (CodeQL) job in `pr-validation.yml` to run on pushes to `develop` and on PRs. This successfully triggered the SAST scan.
    *   User clarified skepticism regarding the SAST scan, suspecting an interaction with GitHub's default security features or caching of results.
    *   Agent performed web searches and explained the relationship between default CodeQL setup, advanced (custom workflow) setup, and GitHub Advanced Security settings.
    *   User confirmed GitHub Advanced Security is enabled.
    *   SAST scan (CodeQL `autobuild` step) ran after the `if` condition fix, but failed due to .NET SDK version mismatch: CodeQL used .NET 8.0.115 for a .NET 9.0 targeted solution, causing `NETSDK1045` errors.
    *   User added `actions/setup-dotnet` to the `sast_scan` job in `pr-validation.yml` (manual edit by user, observed via file attachment).
    *   SAST scan (CodeQL `analyze` step) failed with: "CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled."
    *   User questioned the need for a custom CodeQL workflow (`sast_scan` job) and suggested relying on GitHub's default CodeQL setup.
    *   User attempted Option A (rely on default GitHub CodeQL setup), which failed due to not supporting .NET 9.
    *   User initiated Option B (custom CodeQL workflow) via GitHub UI, which generated a new, separate CodeQL workflow file. User wants to adapt this new file.
    *   Agent provided YAML for the new dedicated CodeQL workflow file (`codeql-analysis.yml`), targeting the `develop` branch for pushes and PRs.
    *   Agent removed the old `sast_scan` job from `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   User asked about the implications of the new CodeQL workflow targeting only the `develop` branch, specifically regarding branch protection rules on `main`.
    *   Agent provided updated YAML for `codeql-analysis.yml` to trigger on pushes and PRs to both `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   **User has indicated the `codeql-analysis.yml` file (with triggers for `main` and `develop`) has been committed to the `main` branch.**

*   **Key Decisions Made (from previous tasks):**
    *   Sanitize or encode user input before logging by replacing newline characters.
*   **Key Decisions (Current Task - Inferred from User & Agent):**
    *   The project uses a `develop` branch for integration (PRs) and `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests are controlled via the `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` environment variable.
    *   GitHub Actions are the primary means of CI/CD automation.
    *   `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` is explicitly set to `"false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
    *   Environment Secrets are used for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`.
    *   The CI pipeline's `dotnet format` step was removed by the user to favor manual code styling.
    *   Targeting specific test project files (`.csproj`) for `dotnet test` in CI, rather than the solution file with filters, resolved test execution errors.
    *   The existing `sast_scan` job in `pr-validation.yml` uses GitHub CodeQL. Its `if` condition was updated to run on PRs and pushes to `develop`.
    *   The `pr-validation.yml` includes a `nuget_vulnerability_scan` job that runs `dotnet list package --vulnerable`.
    *   User has enabled GitHub Advanced Security features for the repository.
    *   The current understanding is that the custom `sast_scan` (CodeQL) job in `pr-validation.yml` is now the primary controller for CodeQL SAST.
    *   User observes that SAST results might be cached or stick if no relevant (C#) code changes occur, which is a plausible compute-saving measure by GitHub.
    *   **The CodeQL `autobuild` step is failing because it's using .NET SDK 8.0.115 to build a .NET 9.0 targeted solution.** (Resolved by user adding `setup-dotnet`)
    *   **The CodeQL `analyze` step is now failing due to a conflict between the custom CodeQL workflow and GitHub's default CodeQL setup.**
    *   **Decision Pending: Whether to remove the custom `sast_scan` job from `pr-validation.yml` and rely solely on GitHub's default CodeQL setup, or to disable the default setup and maintain the custom workflow.**
    *   Relying on GitHub's default CodeQL setup (Option A) is not viable due to lack of .NET 9 support in the default configuration.
    *   **The strategy is now to use a dedicated, custom CodeQL workflow file (Option B), generated by GitHub's "advanced setup" process, and adapt it for the project's needs (especially .NET 9).**
    *   This new dedicated CodeQL workflow will replace the `sast_scan` job previously in `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   The new `codeql-analysis.yml` is configured to trigger on pushes and PRs to both the `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   The `codeql-analysis.yml` file currently exists on the `main` branch.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Ensuring the `develop` branch also has the new `codeql-analysis.yml` and the `pr-validation.yml` has the `sast_scan` job removed.
*   **Hypothesis:** Merging `main` into `develop` will bring the new `codeql-analysis.yml` to `develop` and also propagate the removal of the `sast_scan` job from `pr-validation.yml` if that change was also on `main`.
*   **Pending Actions (for GitHub Actions setup & Documentation):**
    1.  **USER ACTION:** User to merge the `main` branch (which contains the new `codeql-analysis.yml` and the `pr-validation.yml` without the `sast_scan` job) into the `develop` branch.
    2.  **USER ACTION:** After merging, user to push the `develop` branch to origin.
    3.  **TEST & VERIFY:**
        *   Confirm the `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow runs on the push to `develop`.
        *   Confirm the `pr-validation.yml` workflow runs and does *not* attempt to run a `sast_scan` job.
        *   Create a test PR to `develop` to ensure `codeql-analysis.yml` triggers correctly for PRs.
    4.  **CONFIRM:** Verify that GitHub's "default CodeQL setup" remains effectively disabled.
    5.  **IN DISCUSSION (post-fix):** Evaluate if SAST is needed in `release.yml`.
*   **Future Task:** Enable full integration testing in `pr-validation.yml` (set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` to `true`).
*   **Future Task:** Enable Trivy security scanning in `release.yml`.
*   **Future Task:** Implement `release-drafter` or similar for automated release notes.
*   **Future Task:** Adapt the new CodeQL workflow for .NET 9 and project-specific needs.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `develop`
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
    *   Test project files (e.g., `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Integration/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests.csproj`)
    *   Test source files (e.g., `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Integration/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests/InMemoryMessagingTests.cs` to check `TestCategory`)
*   **Files with CodeQL Alerts (previously addressed):**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs`
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised (on hold):** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Ongoing issues with integration test harness paths, leading to `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` being set to `false` in `pr-validation.yml` for the time being.
*   The `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` step was removed from CI by the user.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User emphasizes quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User wants the AgentOps story to clearly and **factually** state AI developments and architectural findings.
*   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
*   Entra Agent ID is a key research focus (completed and integrated into architectural analysis).
*   Resolve CodeQL alerts by sanitizing logged user input (primarily by removing newlines).
*   GitHub Actions should leverage the existing integration test toggle in `NucleusConstants.cs`.
*   The project uses a `develop` branch (transitioned from `Dev` via `main`).
*   Goal is to make the project ready for AI-generated contributions via robust CI.
*   User has manually set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED: "false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
*   User wants to thoroughly scrutinize YAML files and understand secret management best practices.
*   User confirms the necessity of using a specific Google AI API key (implying Gemini) and will manage this via GitHub Secrets.
*   User enthusiastically agreed with "Option 3" for test categorization, which has now been implemented.
*   User brought uncommitted changes from `Dev` to `main` before creating `develop`.
*   User has decided to use GitHub Environment Secrets for the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` and has set up an environment named `ci_tests` with the secret.
*   User confirms no releases are imminent and is interested in using GitHub Actions with conventional commits to automate release notes.
*   User has uploaded `icon.png` to the root of the repo.
*   User noted that Git operations feel more manual compared to Visual Studio's defaults.
*   User prefers their established coding style and disagrees with some "robotic" linting conventions, seeking to make CI less strict or align it with local preferences by making `.editorconfig` more explicit.
*   **User explicitly dislikes `dotnet format` adding/removing blank lines between `using` directive groups.**
*   **User values human-driven styling for readability and questions the strict enforcement of automated style formatting in CI if it overrides human intent.**
*   **User has removed the `dotnet format` step from the CI pipeline.**
*   **User reports that targeting test `.csproj` files directly in CI fixed the `dotnet test` failures.**
*   **User wants to re-enable SAST in the `pr-validation.yml` workflow, similar to default GitHub Actions configurations, and noted it was being skipped.** (Addressed by modifying existing CodeQL job condition).
*   User undid a previous incorrect agent edit to `pr-validation.yml`.
*   User was skeptical that the `if` condition change to the `sast_scan` job was the sole root cause for a SAST scan (likely CodeQL) being skipped, suspecting an interaction with GitHub's default security features or result caching.
*   **User has enabled GitHub Advanced Security features on the repository and is now observing CI behavior after a push.**

## 8. Next Steps (Proposed)

1.  **You should merge your `main` branch into your `develop` branch.** This will bring the new `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` file and the modified `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` (with the `sast_scan` job removed) into `develop`.
    *   A typical command sequence would be:
        ```bash
        git checkout develop
        git pull origin develop # Ensure develop is up-to-date
        git merge main
        # Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
        git push origin develop
        ```
2.  **After pushing `develop`:**
    *   The `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow should trigger and run on `develop`.
    *   The `pr-validation.yml` workflow should also trigger and run its jobs (build, test, nuget scan) but *not* the old `sast_scan` job.
3.  **Test with a Pull Request:** Create a new branch from `develop`, make a small change, and open a PR to `develop`. Verify that the `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow runs as a check on the PR.
4.  Observe the workflow runs and confirm if the CodeQL analysis completes successfully in all targeted scenarios.
5.  Once this is working, we can discuss SAST for `release.yml`.
