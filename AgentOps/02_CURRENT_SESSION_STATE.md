## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Analyze Nucleus architecture against industry AI advancements (post-Microsoft Build 2025) and document findings in an AgentOps story.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Deep Dive Research (Entra Agent ID): Conduct targeted research on "Entra Agent ID" and its implications.
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Update AgentOps Story with Research: Synthesize findings from the Entra Agent ID research and incorporate them into `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Analyzed `Docs/Architecture/04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md` and appended to story.
    4.  **Continue Authoring Story:** Sequentially review the remaining Nucleus architecture documents.
    5.  For each document, analyze its alignment with or need to adapt to the identified AI trends (including Entra Agent ID insights).
    6.  Append these analyses to the AgentOps story file.
    7.  Provide a synthesized summary and recommendations in the story file upon completion of the architectural review.
    8.  Transition to implementing remaining Core MVP functionality for Nucleus once this analysis is complete and documented.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   Initial research on AI advancements (GitHub Copilot open-sourcing, Microsoft Build 2025).
    *   Read `Docs/Architecture/00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`, `Docs/Architecture/01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md`, `Docs/Architecture/02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md`, `Docs/Architecture/03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md`, and `Docs/Architecture/04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md`.
    *   Began authoring `STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md` with initial analyses, and have progressively updated it.
    *   **Correction:** User identified error in MCP definition. Performed web search. User provided definitive correction for MCP as **Model Context Protocol**.
    *   **Refinement:** User highlighted the importance of "Entra Agent ID" from simulated Build 2025 announcements, prompting a focused research task.
    *   **Research Executed & Integrated:** Conducted deep-dive research on "Entra Agent ID" and its implications. Synthesized findings were integrated into the AgentOps story file.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   The current focus is to proactively assess Nucleus's architectural alignment with rapid AI advancements, using accurate information, and document this thoroughly in the designated story file.
    *   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
    *   Entra Agent ID research is complete and integrated into the ongoing architectural analysis.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Read and analyze `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` using the fully corrected and enriched AI context (including Entra ID insights).
*   **Pending Actions (for the story and overall task):**
    1.  Append analysis of `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` to the story.
    2.  Continue this process for all remaining key architectural documents:
        *   `Docs/Architecture/06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md`
        *   `Docs/Architecture/08_ARCHITECTURE_AI_INTEGRATION.md` (Note: `07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md` might be skipped if not directly relevant to AI feature alignment, or analyzed later if it becomes relevant).
        *   `Docs/Architecture/10_ARCHITECTURE_API.md`
        *   `Docs/Architecture/12_ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACTIONS.md`
    3.  Conclude the story with a summary and recommendations.
    4.  Await user guidance to transition to Core MVP tasks.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised:** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`
*   **Architectural Documents Already Analyzed (and updated with Entra ID context where applicable):**
    *   `Docs/Architecture/00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
