## 1. Current Goal & Task

**Goal:** Resolve persistent AMQP transport errors with the Azure Service Bus emulator when accessed by `nucleusapi`.

*   **Previous Step:** Conducted internet search on Microsoft Learn/Blogs for `.NET Aspire` Service Bus Emulator AMQP/TCP issues.
*   **Current Task:** Analyze search results and plan next diagnostic steps based on findings.

## 2. Plan & Action Items

*   **Findings from Web Search:**
    *   Aspire manages Service Bus emulator (and SQL Edge dependency) via Docker, using `RunAsEmulator()`.
    *   Host port for emulator is dynamic by default but can be fixed with `WithHostPort()`.
    *   Aspire injects connection strings; for host process to Docker container, it should be `sb://localhost:<mapped_host_port>`. 
    *   Observed errors ("transport tcpX is closed", `ObjectDisposedException`) point to TCP connection failure, not AMQP idle timeouts.
*   **Plan:** Systematically investigate the TCP connection path from `nucleusapi` to the emulator.
    1.  Update this session state document (`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`). (Done by this edit)
    2.  **INVESTIGATE (User/Cascade):** Next time `Nucleus.AppHost` is run:
        *   **Verify Docker:** Check Docker Desktop (or `docker ps`) to confirm `servicebus-emulator` and `sql-edge` containers are running and note the host port mapped to the emulator's AMQP port (container port 5672).
        *   **Log Connection String:** Modify `nucleusapi` (e.g., in `ServiceBusBackgroundTaskQueue` or startup) to log the full connection string it receives for Service Bus.
    3.  **DIAGNOSE (Cascade):** Compare the logged connection string with the actual mapped port. Ensure it's `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
    4.  **EXPERIMENT (Cascade, if needed):** If issues persist, propose modifying `Nucleus.AppHost/Program.cs` to set a fixed host port for the Service Bus emulator (e.g., `emulator.WithHostPort(5673)`), and update `nucleusapi` to use this if Aspire doesn't automatically reflect it.
    5.  **RE-EVALUATE (User/Cascade):** Re-run and check logs. Consider firewall/antivirus if TCP issues continue.

## 3. Key Files & Focus Areas

*   `Aspire/Nucleus.AppHost/Program.cs`: Service Bus resource definitions.
*   `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Infrastructure/Messaging/ServiceBusBackgroundTaskQueue.cs`: Code location where the Service Bus exceptions originate.
*   `Docs/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_05_Debugging_Aspire_Service_Bus_Emulator.md`: Document to be updated.
*   `tests/Integration/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests/ServiceBusMessagingTests.cs`: The integration test that reliably reproduces this issue.

## 5. Next Steps & Plan

   1.  **DONE (Cascade):** Update this session state document (`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`).
   2.  **AWAIT USER ACTION / NEXT RUN:** User to run `Nucleus.AppHost` and gather information (Docker status, port mapping). Cascade to provide guidance for logging connection string if needed.
   3.  **ANALYZE & DIAGNOSE:** Based on information from the next run, analyze the connection string and port mapping.
   4.  **PROPOSE MODIFICATIONS (if needed):** Suggest code changes for fixed port or further logging.

## 6. Blockers

*   Persistent AMQP transport errors with the Azure Service Bus emulator when accessed by `nucleusapi`.
