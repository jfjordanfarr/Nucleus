## Agent State

-   **Agent Version:** 1.3.0
-   **LLM Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via API)
-   **Current Operation:** MDMD Format Corrections - Addressing PR feedback to properly implement MDMD standard
-   **Current Focus Task:** PR Comments - Fix MDMD implementation with proper {unit} and {composition} directives
-   **Action:** Implement proper MDMD format per specification, address technical clarifications
-   **Overall Progress:** Analyzing feedback and MDMD specification requirements.

## MDMD Correction Task Progress

### Comments to Address
- [x] Comment #2894168238: Major - Implemented proper MDMD standard with `{unit}` and `{composition}` directives, recursive bilayer architecture
- [x] Comment #2124961655: Minor - Updated date reference to current (6/2/2025)
- [x] Comment #2124965439: Technical clarification - Fixed misunderstanding about .NET Aspire's role
- [x] Comment #2124970760: Technical update - Updated prompt caching information

### MDMD Implementation Completed
- [x] Implemented MyST Markdown with `{unit}` and `{composition}` directives
- [x] Recursive bilayer architecture: demonstrated "bilayers exist all the way down" concept
- [x] Proper strata organization with Definition/Specification bilayers at each level
- [x] Converted key files to demonstrate proper MDMD format:
  - AIIntegrationRequirements.MDMD.md - Requirements composition with typed units
  - SystemExecutiveSummary.MDMD.md - Vision composition with architectural units
  - M365AgentsOverview.MDMD.md - Concept composition with technical units
  - Created README files showing recursive bilayer structure
- [x] All implemented files include stratum identification, connection specifications, and typed units with implementation targets

### Current Documentation Analysis
- [x] Created 2-strata MDMD structure for both target directories
- [x] Converted 28 core documents to MDMD format with .MDMD.md naming
- [x] Organized into Definition (Vision/Requirements) and Specification (Concepts/Implementations)
- [x] Created navigation overview files for both directories
- [x] Started updating cross-references to reflect new structure

### MDMD Structure Completed
**docs/Architecture/:**
- Definition/Vision: 3 files (SystemExecutiveSummary, ComprehensiveArchitectureGuide, FoundationsTechnologyPrimer)
- Definition/Requirements: 1 file (SecurityRequirements)
- Specification/Concepts: 6 files (M365Agents, McpTools, Deployment, DevelopmentLifecycle, ProcessingIngestion, PersonaDesigns overviews)
- Specification/Implementations: 11 files (MCP tool implementations, persona designs, testing, CICD, namespace structure)

**docs/ProjectExecutionPlan/:**
- Definition/Vision: 1 file (ProjectMandate)
- Definition/Requirements: 4 files (Phase1-4 requirements)
- Specification/Concepts: 1 file (DevelopmentRoadmap)
- Specification/Implementations: 4 files (Phase1-4 implementation tasks)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete cross-reference updates in all MDMD files
- [ ] Add remaining specialized documents if needed
- [ ] Validate all links work correctly
- [ ] Final verification and testing

## Agent Notes & Reminders:

-   MDMD format successfully implemented with 2-strata approach
-   All core documents converted and organized appropriately
-   Navigation structure created for discoverability
-   Focus on finishing cross-reference updates and validation
-   Content preserved during conversion, only structure changed
-   C# implementation remains unchanged as specified in the issue
