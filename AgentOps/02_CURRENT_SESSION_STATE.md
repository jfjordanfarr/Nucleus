## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Establish robust GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and ensure corresponding documentation is accurate.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`).
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests (with `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` set to `false` for now) and uses simplified test filters.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing in workflows, deciding on Environment Secrets.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update the necessary workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Manage project branches: Stashed changes on `Dev`, checked out `main`, applied stash, created `develop` from `main`, and deleted `Dev`.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** User has set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests` with the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` secret.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Updated workflow files (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`) to use the `ci_tests` environment.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   Completed branch transition from `Dev` to `develop` via `main`.
    *   Discussed GitHub secret scoping, user decided on Environment Secrets.
    *   User confirmed creation of environment `ci_tests` and secret `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`.
    *   Updated workflow YAMLs to use the `ci_tests` environment.
*   **Key Decisions Made (from previous tasks):**
    *   Sanitize or encode user input before logging by replacing newline characters.
*   **Key Decisions (Current Task - Inferred from User & Agent):**
    *   The project uses a `develop` branch for integration (PRs) and `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests are controlled via the `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` environment variable, read by the application from `NucleusConstants.cs`.
    *   GitHub Actions are the primary means of CI/CD automation, with workflows defined in `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
    *   `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` is explicitly set to `"false"` in the `pr-validation.yml` workflow's `integration_test` job due to ongoing issues with integration test harness paths.
    *   For integration tests requiring a specific Google AI API key, the project uses **Environment Secrets** in GitHub Actions (`GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` scoped to the `ci_tests` environment).
    *   **COMPLETED ACTION (Test Categorization & Workflow Update):** Adopted "Option 3" for test categorization. All integration tests within `*.IntegrationTests` namespaces were explicitly marked with `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`. `pr-validation.yml` was updated to use simplified filters (`Category=Integration` and `Category!=Integration`). C# test files updated accordingly.
    *   **COMPLETED ACTION (Branching Strategy):** Stashed uncommitted changes on `Dev`, checked out `main`, applied the stashed changes to `main`, created the `develop` branch from this updated `main` branch, and deleted the `Dev` branch.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Final checks before user commits to `develop` and creates a PR to `main`. This includes:
    1.  Performing a .NET version consistency check across relevant files (target: .NET 9).
    2.  Finalizing `ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md` with details on changelog strategy and `icon.png` usage.
*   **Pending Actions (for GitHub Actions setup & Documentation):**
    1.  **ACTIVE AGENT TASK:** Perform .NET version consistency check (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md`).
    2.  **ACTIVE AGENT TASK:** Update `Docs/Architecture/Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md` with details on changelog strategy, and ensure `icon.png` usage for `Directory.Build.props` is clearly documented.
    3.  **User Action (Post-Commit & PR):** User to add actual `icon.png` to `/workspaces/Nucleus/icon.png` if the current one is a placeholder.
    4.  **Future Task:** Enable full integration testing in `pr-validation.yml`.
    5.  **Future Task:** Enable Trivy security scanning in `release.yml`.
    6.  **Future Task:** Implement `release-drafter` or similar for automated release notes.
*   **Pending Actions (for the story and overall task - previously on hold, remains on hold):**
    1.  Read and analyze `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`.
    2.  Append analysis of `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` to the story.
    3.  Continue this process for all remaining key architectural documents.
    4.  Conclude the story with a summary and recommendations.
    5.  Await user guidance to transition to Core MVP tasks.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `develop`
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `Docs/Architecture/Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md`
    *   `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
    *   `.github/workflows/release.yml`
*   **Files with CodeQL Alerts (previously addressed):**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs`
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised (on hold):** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Ongoing issues with integration test harness paths, leading to `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` being set to `false` in `pr-validation.yml` for the time being.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User emphasizes quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User wants the AgentOps story to clearly and **factually** state AI developments and architectural findings.
*   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
*   Entra Agent ID is a key research focus (completed and integrated into architectural analysis).
*   Resolve CodeQL alerts by sanitizing logged user input (primarily by removing newlines).
*   GitHub Actions should leverage the existing integration test toggle in `NucleusConstants.cs`.
*   The project uses a `develop` branch (transitioned from `Dev` via `main`).
*   Goal is to make the project ready for AI-generated contributions via robust CI.
*   User has manually set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED: "false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
*   User wants to thoroughly scrutinize YAML files and understand secret management best practices.
*   User confirms the necessity of using a specific Google AI API key (implying Gemini) and will manage this via GitHub Secrets.
*   User enthusiastically agreed with "Option 3" for test categorization, which has now been implemented.
*   User brought uncommitted changes from `Dev` to `main` before creating `develop`.
*   User has decided to use GitHub Environment Secrets for the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` and has set up an environment named `ci_tests` with the secret.
*   User confirms no releases are imminent and is interested in using GitHub Actions with conventional commits to automate release notes.
*   User will upload `icon.png` to the root of the repo for `Directory.Build.props`.

## 8. Next Steps (Proposed)

1.  **Perform .NET version consistency check.**
2.  **Update `ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md`** with information on changelog strategy and `icon.png` usage, ensuring .NET version consistency.
3.  **Advise user on final steps before PR:** committing changes to `develop`, ensuring `icon.png` is correct.
4.  **Await User Review & Guidance:** For next steps after the PR is merged.
