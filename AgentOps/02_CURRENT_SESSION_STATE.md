## Agent State

-   **Agent Version:** 1.3.0
-   **LLM Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via API)
-   **Current Operation:** MDMD Format Conversion - Converting docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan to MDMD format
-   **Current Focus Task:** Issue #11 - Convert docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan/ to MDMD.md format
-   **Action:** Transform documentation structure to match MDMD 2-strata pattern (Definition/Specification strata)
-   **Overall Progress:** Initial exploration and planning phase.

## MDMD Conversion Task Progress

### Task Understanding
- [x] Understand issue requirements: Convert docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan to MDMD format
- [x] Review current documentation structure
- [x] Research MDMD specification from referenced repository
- [x] Analyze 2-strata pattern (Definition vs Specification strata)
- [x] Plan conversion strategy (Definition vs Specification strata)
- [x] Execute initial conversion with key documents

### Current Documentation Analysis
- [x] Created 2-strata MDMD structure for both target directories
- [x] Converted 28 core documents to MDMD format with .MDMD.md naming
- [x] Organized into Definition (Vision/Requirements) and Specification (Concepts/Implementations)
- [x] Created navigation overview files for both directories
- [x] Started updating cross-references to reflect new structure

### MDMD Structure Completed
**docs/Architecture/:**
- Definition/Vision: 3 files (SystemExecutiveSummary, ComprehensiveArchitectureGuide, FoundationsTechnologyPrimer)
- Definition/Requirements: 1 file (SecurityRequirements)
- Specification/Concepts: 6 files (M365Agents, McpTools, Deployment, DevelopmentLifecycle, ProcessingIngestion, PersonaDesigns overviews)
- Specification/Implementations: 11 files (MCP tool implementations, persona designs, testing, CICD, namespace structure)

**docs/ProjectExecutionPlan/:**
- Definition/Vision: 1 file (ProjectMandate)
- Definition/Requirements: 4 files (Phase1-4 requirements)
- Specification/Concepts: 1 file (DevelopmentRoadmap)
- Specification/Implementations: 4 files (Phase1-4 implementation tasks)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete cross-reference updates in all MDMD files
- [ ] Add remaining specialized documents if needed
- [ ] Validate all links work correctly
- [ ] Final verification and testing

## Agent Notes & Reminders:

-   MDMD format successfully implemented with 2-strata approach
-   All core documents converted and organized appropriately
-   Navigation structure created for discoverability
-   Focus on finishing cross-reference updates and validation
-   Content preserved during conversion, only structure changed
-   C# implementation remains unchanged as specified in the issue
