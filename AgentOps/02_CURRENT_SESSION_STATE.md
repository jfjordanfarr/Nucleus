## üîÑ Session Info

*   **Time:** `20:44 UTC-4` *(Approximate time of state update)*
*   **Developer:** `jfjordanfarr` (Lead)

## üéØ Active Task (from Kanban)

*   **ID/Name:** `TASK-MVP-ARCH-01`: Pivot to Console App MVP
*   **Goal:** Update project structure, architecture documents, and AppHost configuration to reflect the shift from a Blazor WebApp frontend to a Console Application (`Nucleus.Console`) as the primary MVP interaction point.

---

## üî¨ Current Focus / Micro-Goal

*   Refactor architecture documentation and AppHost configuration to align with the Console App MVP strategy.

---

## ‚è™ Last Action(s) Taken

*   **Added `Nucleus.Console` Project:** Created a new .NET Console App project (`src/Nucleus.Console`) and added it to `NucleusOmniRAG.sln`.
*   **Updated `00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`:** Revised overview doc (`docs/Architecture/`) to reflect Console App MVP.
*   **Renamed/Rewrote `05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`:** Renamed from `_FRONTEND` (`docs/Architecture/`) and rewrote content to focus on Console App architecture, command structure, and future platform integration.
*   **Updated `Nucleus.AppHost\Program.cs`:** Removed definition of `webApp` project. Confirmed `consoleApp` is defined and referenced correctly (`AddProject<Projects.Nucleus_Console>`). Removed reference to Functions project (commented out).
*   **Updated `Nucleus.AppHost.csproj`:** Removed `ProjectReference` for `Nucleus.WebApp` and `Nucleus.Functions`. Added `ProjectReference` for `Nucleus.Console`.
*   **Ran `dotnet restore`:** Restored packages for `Nucleus.AppHost` after `.csproj` changes.

---

## ‚ùó Current Error / Blocker (if any)

*   None directly related to the current task. Build warnings (`MSB4011` - SDK import duplication) were observed during `dotnet restore` but did not prevent completion. Existing lint errors in `Nucleus.Api` and `Nucleus.AppHost` (missing namespaces/types before restore) should now be resolved, but verification via build is pending.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Immediate Next Step

1.  **Update Kanban Board:** Move `TASK-MVP-ARCH-01` (or a relevant sub-task like updating AppHost/Docs) to 'Done' on `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
2.  **Update Other Docs:** Review and update other potentially affected documents in `docs/Planning/` and `docs/Requirements/` to reflect the Console App MVP approach.
3.  **Build Solution:** Run `dotnet build` on the solution to verify the AppHost changes and ensure no new build errors were introduced.

---

## ‚ùì Open Questions / Verification Needed

*   Are there other documents in `docs/Planning` or `docs/Requirements` that need immediate updates due to the Console App pivot?
