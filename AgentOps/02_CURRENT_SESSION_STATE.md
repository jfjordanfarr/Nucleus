## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues and finalize GitHub Actions workflows, specifically the CodeQL SAST scan.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`).
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update workflow files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Manage project branches.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** User set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Updated workflows to use `ci_tests` environment.
    8.  **COMPLETED (Locally):** Resolved local build issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Resolved Git branch divergence on `develop`.
    10. **COMPLETED:** User merged `main` (with new `codeql.yml` and updated `pr-validation.yml`) into `develop`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Corrected the MSB9008 build failure for `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj` by changing its reference in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` from `../../../../src/...` to `../../../src/...`.
    12. **REOPENED (Current Focus):** Build is failing again with MSB9008 for `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj` in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`. Previous path corrections by the agent were likely incorrect. Re-evaluating paths.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   User successfully rebased local `develop` on `origin/develop` and pushed changes.
    *   CI pipeline build step passed, but `dotnet format` failed (subsequently removed by user).
    *   Agent modified `pr-validation.yml` to target integration test `.csproj` directly, resolving `dotnet test` failures.
    *   Agent fixed `if` condition for `sast_scan` (CodeQL) job in `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   CodeQL `autobuild` failed due to .NET SDK version mismatch (resolved by user adding `setup-dotnet`).
    *   CodeQL `analyze` failed due to conflict with default setup.
    *   User opted for a dedicated custom CodeQL workflow (`codeql.yml`, initially `codeql-analysis.yml`).
    *   Agent provided YAML for `codeql.yml` targeting `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   Agent removed the old `sast_scan` job from `pr-validation.yml`.
    *   User committed `codeql.yml` to `main` and then merged `main` into `develop`.
    *   **A CodeQL `autobuild` step was failing with an `MSB9008` error, indicating a referenced project (`Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj`) did not exist due to an incorrect relative path in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`. This was corrected by the agent.**
    *   User expressed concern about the integrity of the `develop` branch post-merge from `main`.
    *   User inquired about discrepancies in relative paths within `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    *   Agent attempted to correct paths in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    *   **User ran `dotnet build` which failed, indicating the path to `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj` is still incorrect (MSB9008). User is concerned about build stability after merging `main` into `develop`.**

*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Project uses `develop` for integration, `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests controlled by `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED`.
    *   Environment Secrets used for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`.
    *   `dotnet format` step removed from CI.
    *   Target specific test `.csproj` files for `dotnet test` in CI.
    *   Use a dedicated custom CodeQL workflow (`codeql.yml`) instead of the `sast_scan` job in `pr-validation.yml` or GitHub's default setup.
    *   The `codeql.yml` file is configured for .NET 9 and C# analysis.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Resolve the MSB9008 build error in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` by correctly identifying and setting the relative paths for all `ProjectReference` items.
*   **Pending Actions:**
    1.  **AGENT ACTION (In Progress):** Re-evaluate and determine the correct relative paths for project references in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    2.  **AGENT ACTION:** Read the current content of the `.csproj` file.
    3.  **AGENT ACTION:** Propose corrections based on the re-evaluation and current file content.
    4.  **AGENT ACTION (If approved):** Apply the changes using `insert_edit_into_file`.
    5.  **USER ACTION:** Run `dotnet build` locally to confirm the fix.
    6.  **USER ACTION (If build succeeds):** Commit and push the fix to `develop`.
    7.  **TEST & VERIFY:**
        *   Confirm the `codeql.yml` workflow runs on the push to `develop` and the `autobuild` step succeeds.
        *   Confirm the CodeQL analysis completes.
    8.  **IN DISCUSSION (post-fix):** Evaluate if SAST is needed in `release.yml`.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `develop` (assumed, after user merged `main` into `develop`)
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   The MSB9008 error due to incorrect `ProjectReference` paths in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` is the primary blocker.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User values quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User prefers their established coding style and has removed automated formatting from CI.
*   User wants to ensure SAST (CodeQL) is functioning correctly.

## 8. Next Steps (Post-Fix)

1.  After the project reference fix is pushed and verified:
    *   Observe the `codeql.yml` workflow run on `develop`.
    *   If successful, create a test PR to `develop` to ensure `codeql.yml` also triggers correctly for PRs.
2.  Discuss SAST for `release.yml`.
