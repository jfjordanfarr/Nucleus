## Agent Notes

*   Completed TRACS Pass for ProjectExecutionPlan.
*   Initiating TRACS Pass for Architecture_MCP_Tools.
*   Current focus: `Docs/Architecture/McpTools/RAGPipeline/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md`.
*   Will apply detailed refinements provided by the user to ensure consistency with other MCP tool designs and overall architecture.
*   Key areas: Frontmatter, DTO clarifications (especially `UserQueryVector` handling), ensuring LLM calls for query expansion go via `LlmOrchestrationMCP`, confirming dependency lists and authentication mechanisms.

## Pending User Input/Clarification

*   User to review changes to `Docs/Architecture/McpTools/RAGPipeline/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_RAG_PIPELINE.md` once applied.
*   (Carry-over from TRACS Pass 3) User to provide instructions for `Docs/Architecture/McpTools/ToolOrchestration/ARCHITECTURE_MCPTOOL_TOOL_ORCHESTRATION.md`.
*   Guidance for `LlmOrchestrationMCP` when its turn comes.
*   Guidance for creating new Admin MCP Tool documents.
*   (Carry-over from previous TRACS passes) User to manually address file renames and archival tasks.
