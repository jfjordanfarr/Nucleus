## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Establish robust GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD to enable confident acceptance of contributions (including AI-generated) to the open-source Nucleus project.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`).
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests (with `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` set to `false` for now) and uses simplified test filters.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing in workflows.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update the necessary workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.
    5.  **ACTIVE:** Manage project branches: Stash changes on `Dev`, checkout `main`, apply stash, then create `develop` from `main`.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   Searched for `NucleusConstants.cs` and its usages.
    *   Created initial drafts of `pr-validation.yml` and `release.yml`.
    *   Discussed environment variable sourcing and GitHub secret naming conventions.
    *   Researched "GitHub Models" feature for AI API keys.
*   **Key Decisions Made (from previous tasks):**
    *   Sanitize or encode user input before logging by replacing newline characters.
*   **Key Decisions (Current Task - Inferred from User & Agent):**
    *   The project uses a `develop` branch for integration, and `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests are controlled via the `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` environment variable, read by the application from `NucleusConstants.cs`.
    *   GitHub Actions should be the primary means of CI/CD automation.
    *   `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` is explicitly set to `"false"` in the `pr-validation.yml` workflow's `integration_test` job due to ongoing issues with integration test harness paths.
    *   For integration tests requiring a specific Google AI API key, the project will use GitHub Secrets (e.g., `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`). The "GitHub Models" feature is not suitable for this.
    *   **COMPLETED ACTION (Test Categorization & Workflow Update):** Adopted "Option 3" for test categorization. All integration tests within `*.IntegrationTests` namespaces were explicitly marked with `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`. `pr-validation.yml` was updated to use simplified filters (`Category=Integration` and `Category!=Integration`). C# test files (`ApiIntegrationTests.cs`, `InMemoryMessagingTests.cs`, `LocalAdapterScopingTests.cs`, `MinimalCosmosEmulatorTest.cs`, `ServiceBusMessagingTests.cs`) were updated accordingly.
    *   **REVISED DECISION (Branching Strategy):** Instead of creating `develop` from `Dev`, the plan is now to stash uncommitted changes on `Dev`, checkout `main`, apply the stashed changes to `main`, and then create the `develop` branch from this updated `main` branch. The `Dev` branch will then be deleted.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Branch Management (Revised Strategy).
    1.  Stash uncommitted changes on `Dev`.
    2.  Checkout `main`.
    3.  Apply stashed changes to `main`.
    4.  Create `develop` branch from `main`.
    5.  Push `develop` branch to remote.
    6.  Delete `Dev` branch (locally and remotely).
*   **Pending Actions (for GitHub Actions setup):**
    1.  Final review of `release.yml`.
    2.  **User Task:** Create the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` secret in the GitHub repository settings.
    3.  **Future Task:** Enable full integration testing in `pr-validation.yml` by:
        *   Uncommenting the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` environment variable.
        *   Changing `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED: "false"` to `"true"` once underlying test issues are resolved.
*   **Pending Actions (for the story and overall task - previously on hold, remains on hold):**
    1.  Read and analyze `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`.
    2.  Append analysis of `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` to the story.
    3.  Continue this process for all remaining key architectural documents.
    4.  Conclude the story with a summary and recommendations.
    5.  Await user guidance to transition to Core MVP tasks.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `Dev`
*   **Target Git Branch for Stash Application:** `main`
*   **Target Git Branch for Creation:** `develop` (from updated `main`)
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
    *   `.github/workflows/release.yml`
*   **Files with CodeQL Alerts (previously addressed):**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs`
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised (on hold):** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Ongoing issues with integration test harness paths, leading to `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` being set to `false` in `pr-validation.yml` for the time being.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User emphasizes quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User wants the AgentOps story to clearly and **factually** state AI developments and architectural findings.
*   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
*   Entra Agent ID is a key research focus (completed and integrated into architectural analysis).
*   Resolve CodeQL alerts by sanitizing logged user input (primarily by removing newlines).
*   GitHub Actions should leverage the existing integration test toggle in `NucleusConstants.cs`.
*   The project will use a `develop` branch (transitioning from `Dev`, now via `main`).
*   Goal is to make the project ready for AI-generated contributions via robust CI.
*   User has manually set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED: "false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
*   User wants to thoroughly scrutinize YAML files and understand secret management best practices.
*   User confirms the necessity of using a specific Google AI API key (implying Gemini) and will manage this via GitHub Secrets.
*   User enthusiastically agreed with "Option 3" for test categorization, which has now been implemented.
*   User wants to bring uncommitted changes from `Dev` to `main` before creating `develop`.

## 8. Next Steps (Proposed)

1.  **Branch Management (Revised):**
    *   Execute `git stash push -u -m "Changes for develop branch setup"` (to stash uncommitted and new files on `Dev`).
    *   Execute `git checkout main` (to switch to the `main` branch).
    *   Execute `git stash pop` (to apply the stashed changes to `main`).
    *   Execute `git add .` (to stage any newly untracked files that were part of the stash).
    *   Execute `git commit -m "Apply stashed changes from Dev branch for develop setup"` (to commit the changes on `main`).
    *   Execute `git branch develop` (to create `develop` from the updated `main`).
    *   Execute `git checkout develop` (to switch to the new `develop` branch).
    *   Execute `git push origin develop` (to push the new `develop` branch to remote).
    *   Execute `git push origin --delete Dev` (to delete the remote `Dev` branch).
    *   Execute `git branch -d Dev` (to delete the local `Dev` branch).
2.  **Finalize Review of `release.yml`**: Read and confirm its settings.
3.  **Await User Action:** User to create the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` GitHub secret.
4.  **Await User Guidance:** For enabling full integration testing or moving to other tasks.
