## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Overall Task Definition

The primary goal is to resolve all CodeQL scan warnings and unit test failures in the Nucleus project. This includes addressing "Log entries created from user input" (completed), "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" warnings (addressed), fixing unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests.cs` (completed, but a regression has occurred), and refining CI pipeline configurations (completed).

## 3. Current Task & Sub-Tasks

**Current Focus:** Resolve unit test regression in `InteractionControllerTests.Post_WithInvalidAdapterRequestProperties_ReturnsBadRequest`. Four tests are failing because they expect `BadRequestObjectResult` but receive `ObjectResult`.

*   **Overall Progress:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Resolve runtime DI errors in `Nucleus.AppHost`.
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Verify application startup.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Initial manual fix for CodeQL "Log entries created from user input" warnings.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Confirm CodeQL "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings are in non-executable example files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Create `StringExtensions.cs` with `SanitizeLogInput` method.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** Implement global usings for `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Abstractions.Utils`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Refactor all identified files to use `SanitizeLogInput` extension method.
    8.  **COMPLETED:** Fix CI pipeline test results path for TRX logger.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Address CI pipeline `System.UnauthorizedAccessException` for `/unit_test_diag.log` by adding a directory creation step.
    10. **COMPLETED (REGRESSION):** Investigate and fix 9 unit test failures in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs` by correcting `IActionResult` types in `InteractionController.cs`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Investigate CodeQL warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` and `LocalAdapter.cs`.
    12. **COMPLETED:** Address PR comment in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` regarding logger creation pattern.
    13. **COMPLETED:** Resolve CodeQL branch protection rule blocking merges due to configuration mismatches.
        *   **Action:** Modified `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` language matrix to `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`.
        *   **Action:** Removed redundant `security_code_scan` job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`.
    14. **COMPLETED:** Address CodeQL C# warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` by implementing `ModelState.IsValid` checks after adding data annotations to `AdapterRequest`.
    15. **COMPLETED:** Refactor `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput` to have its `defaultValue` parameter default to "N/A" and updated calls in `LocalAdapter.cs`.
    16. **PENDING (NEW):** Fix unit test regression in `InteractionControllerTests`.
    17. **PENDING:** User review and approval of all changes.
    18. **PENDING:** User re-run CodeQL scan and tests in CI to confirm all fixes.

*   **Detailed Sub-Tasks (Current Focus):**
    *   **Fix `InteractionControllerTests` Regression:**
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Analyze `InteractionController.cs` to see how `BadRequest` is returned when `ModelState` is invalid.
        *   **TODO:** Analyze `InteractionControllerTests.cs` for the failing tests.
        *   **TODO:** Modify `InteractionController.cs` to return `BadRequestObjectResult` (e.g., using `BadRequest(ModelState)` or `BadRequest(object)`) instead of a generic `ObjectResult` with a 400 status.
        *   **TODO:** Re-run tests to confirm the fix.

## 4. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Turn Summary:** User reported unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests` after pushing recent changes. The failures indicate an `Assert.IsType()` mismatch: expected `BadRequestObjectResult`, got `ObjectResult`.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Prioritize fixing the unit test regression.
*   **Search/Analysis Results:**
    *   Test logs show 4 failures in `InteractionControllerTests.Post_WithInvalidAdapterRequestProperties_ReturnsBadRequest`.
*   **Pending User Feedback/Actions:**
    *   Await confirmation after the fix for the test regression.

## 5. Current Contextual Information

*   **User Instructions:** Adhere to Nucleus project mandate, quality over expedience, documentation as source code, context/cross-checking, persona-centric design, and core principles.
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` (target for fix)
    *   `tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs` (contains failing tests)
*   **Test Failure:** `Assert.IsType()` Failure: Expected `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.BadRequestObjectResult`, Actual `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ObjectResult`.

## 6. Agent's Scratchpad & Next Steps

1.  **Current Step:** Update this session state document. (Completed)
2.  **Next Step:** Read `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs`.
3.  **Then:** Read `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs`.
4.  **Then:** Propose and apply changes to `InteractionController.cs` to return `BadRequestObjectResult`.
5.  **Then:** Request user to re-run tests or run them if possible.
6.  **Future Steps:**
    *   Await user review and CI re-run.
    *   Advise on re-baselining `main` if necessary for general CodeQL workflow alignment.
