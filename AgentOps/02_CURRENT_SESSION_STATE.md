*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CodeQL scan warnings.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`).
    2.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests.
    3.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing.
    4.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Create/update workflow files.
    5.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Manage project branches.
    6.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** User set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests`.
    7.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Updated workflows to use `ci_tests` environment.
    8.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Resolved local build issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    9.  **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Resolved Git branch divergence on `develop`.
    10. **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** User merged `main` (with new `codeql.yml` and updated `pr-validation.yml`) into `develop`.
    11. **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Corrected the MSB9008 build failure for `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj`.
    12. **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Resolved MSB9008 build error in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj`.
    13. **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED:** Resolved CodeQL analysis issues by configuring `codeql.yml` for C#, JS/TS, and Python.
    14. **COMPLETED:** Resolve DI resolution issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api` when running `Nucleus.AppHost`.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Fixed `IBackgroundTaskQueue` registration.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Fixed build error CS0266.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Resolved `System.InvalidOperationException: No service for type 'Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local.LocalFileArtifactProvider' has been registered.` by adding `services.AddSingleton<LocalFileArtifactProvider>();` in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Adapters/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
    15. **COMPLETED:** Address CodeQL "Log entries created from user input" warnings.
        *   Focus on High severity warnings first.
        *   Primary fix: Sanitize log inputs by removing newline characters.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Adapters/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local/LocalAdapter.cs`.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Domain/Processing/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` (and addressed related nullability warnings).
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Messaging/InMemoryBackgroundTaskQueue.cs`.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Infrastructure/Messaging/NullBackgroundTaskQueue.cs`.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Domain/Processing/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/ActivationChecker.cs`.
        *   **COMPLETED:** Sanitized logs in `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs`.
    16. **COMPLETED (for executable code):** Address CodeQL "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings (Medium severity).
        *   **USER FEEDBACK:** Warnings were located in HTML example files within `Docs/Architecture/Processing/Dataviz/Examples/`, not in application C# code.
        *   These are considered documentation artifacts and do not require code changes to the application itself for this warning type.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   User confirmed that all "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings are in HTML example files.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   The "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" CodeQL warning category is now considered complete for the application's executable code, as all identified warnings are in documentation example files.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Determine if there are any other CodeQL warning categories to address.
*   **Pending Actions:**
    1.  **USER ACTION (AWAITING RESPONSE):** Are there any other CodeQL warning categories that need to be addressed? If not, we can consider the CodeQL task complete.
    2.  **USER ACTION (LATER):** After all relevant fixes are applied (if any more are needed), re-run CodeQL scan or commit changes for PR validation.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `develop`
*   **Key Files for Current Task (CodeQL "Log entries created from user input"):**
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Adapters/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local/LocalAdapter.cs` (Completed)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Domain/Processing/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` (Completed)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Messaging/InMemoryBackgroundTaskQueue.cs` (Completed)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Infrastructure/Messaging/NullBackgroundTaskQueue.cs` (Completed)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Domain/Processing/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/ActivationChecker.cs` (Completed)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` (Completed for log sanitization)
    *   `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Multiple CodeQL warnings of type "Log entries created from user input" (High severity).
*   Multiple CodeQL warnings of type "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" (Medium severity) - to be addressed later.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User values quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User prefers their established coding style.
*   User wants the application to be runnable and minimally functional on the `develop` branch.
*   For "Log entries created from user input", the primary fix is removing newlines.

## 8. Next Steps (Post-Fix)

1.  Complete addressing all high-priority CodeQL warnings.
2.  Discuss medium-priority CodeQL warnings.
3.  User to trigger a new CodeQL scan to verify fixes.
