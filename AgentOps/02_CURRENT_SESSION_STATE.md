## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Overall Task Definition

The primary goal is to resolve all CodeQL scan warnings and unit test failures in the Nucleus project. This includes addressing "Log entries created from user input" (completed), new "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" warnings (assessed as likely false positives), fixing unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests.cs` (completed), and refining CI pipeline configurations (logger creation pattern addressed, CodeQL configuration mismatch under investigation and being actively addressed).

## 3. Current Task & Sub-Tasks

**Current Focus:** Resolve CodeQL branch protection issues by consolidating CodeQL workflows and correcting the language matrix to match historical expectations from the `main` branch.

*   **Overall Progress:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Resolve runtime DI errors in `Nucleus.AppHost`.
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Verify application startup.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Initial manual fix for CodeQL "Log entries created from user input" warnings.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Confirm CodeQL "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings are in non-executable example files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Create `StringExtensions.cs` with `SanitizeLogInput` method.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** Implement global usings for `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Abstractions.Utils`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Refactor all identified files to use `SanitizeLogInput` extension method.
    8.  **COMPLETED:** Fix CI pipeline test results path for TRX logger.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Address CI pipeline `System.UnauthorizedAccessException` for `/unit_test_diag.log` by adding a directory creation step.
    10. **COMPLETED:** Investigate and fix 9 unit test failures in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs` by correcting `IActionResult` types in `InteractionController.cs`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Investigate CodeQL warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` and `LocalAdapter.cs`. Assessed as likely false positives due to safe handling of data.
    12. **COMPLETED:** Address PR comment in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` regarding logger creation pattern.
    13. **COMPLETED:** Resolve CodeQL branch protection rule blocking merges due to configuration mismatches for `javascript-typescript` and `csharp` between `main` and `develop`/PR branches.
        *   **Action:** Modified `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` language matrix to `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`. (User manually re-added 'python' after my previous edit).
        *   **Next Action:** Removing redundant CodeQL job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`.
    14. **PENDING:** User review and approval of all changes.
    15. **PENDING:** User re-run CodeQL scan and tests in CI to confirm all fixes, particularly on a PR to `main` to re-baseline expectations.

*   **Detailed Sub-Tasks (Current Focus):**
    *   **CodeQL Branch Protection Resolution & Workflow Consolidation:**
        *   **DONE:** Analyze CodeQL workflow files (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `pr-validation.yml`) and compare with reported expectations from `main`.
        *   **DONE:** Modify `language` matrix in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`. (User confirmed 'python' should be present).
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Remove the `security_code_scan` job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` to consolidate CodeQL analysis.
        *   **PENDING:** Advise on merging to `main` to re-baseline CodeQL expectations if issues persist.

## 4. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Turn Summary:** User confirmed that the change from `javascript` to `javascript-typescript` in `codeql.yml` was correct, but noted that `python` was inadvertently removed and they manually re-added it. The goal remains to consolidate CodeQL workflows.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Plan to consolidate CodeQL analysis into `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`.
    *   The language matrix in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` is now `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']` (user confirmed 'python' inclusion).
*   **Search/Analysis Results:**
    *   `codeql.yml` now has the corrected language matrix. The CodeQL job in `pr-validation.yml` uses `language: ['csharp', 'javascript']` and is redundant.
    *   Error messages from GitHub indicate `main` expects `language:javascript-typescript` (from Default setup) and `language:csharp` (from an Actions workflow). The inclusion of 'python' in `codeql.yml` might also need to be reflected on `main` eventually.
*   **Pending User Feedback/Actions:**
    *   Review and approve proposed workflow changes.
    *   Commit changes and observe CodeQL behavior on the PR.
    *   Consider strategy for updating `main` branch's CodeQL baseline.

## 5. Current Contextual Information

*   **User Instructions:** Adhere to Nucleus project mandate, quality over expedience, documentation as source code, context/cross-checking, persona-centric design, and core principles.
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (language matrix updated by user)
    *   `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` (target for removal of redundant CodeQL job)
*   **CodeQL Issue:** Merging blocked. CodeQL expects results for `language:javascript-typescript` and `language:csharp` from past commits on `main`. Current PR scans need to align, and `codeql.yml` is now the designated primary configuration.

## 6. Agent's Scratchpad & Next Steps

1.  **Current Step:** Update this session state document.
2.  **Next Step:** Propose the removal of the `security_code_scan` job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`.
3.  **Future Steps:**
    *   Await user review and CI re-run.
    *   Advise on re-baselining `main` if necessary.
