## Session Focus

The primary goal is to address the CA2000 warnings identified in `Nucleus.Domain.Tests.QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs` after all tests passed in the previous step.

## Current Task

Fix the CA2000 warnings in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Domain.Tests/QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs` related to disposable objects not being disposed.

## Pending Actions

1.  **Read `QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs`** to identify the exact locations of the warnings.
2.  **Modify the test methods** to ensure `IDisposable` objects (`ArtifactContent`, `QueuedInteractionProcessorService`) are properly disposed, likely using `using` statements.
3.  **Run `dotnet test`** to confirm the warnings are resolved and all unit tests still pass.
4.  If warnings are gone and tests pass, shift focus to implementing the remaining Core MVP functionality.

## Key Files & Context

*   **Test File:** `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Domain.Tests/QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs`
*   **Service Under Test:** `/workspaces/Nucleus/src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/QueuedInteractionProcessorService.cs`
*   **Project Mandate & Requirements:**

    *   `Docs/Architecture/01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md`

## Recent Changes Summary (from v3.94)

*   All tests in `QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs` passed.
*   Identified 3 CA2000 warnings in the test output for `ArtifactContent` and `QueuedInteractionProcessorService` instances not being disposed.

## Watched Files for Next Update Cycle
*   `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Domain.Tests/QueuedInteractionProcessorServiceTests.cs` (for warning resolution and test results)

## Agent Confidence Score (1-5)
5 (Confident in resolving these types of warnings)

## Next Steps Outline

1.  Read the test file.
2.  Apply `using` statements to the disposable objects causing warnings.
3.  Execute `dotnet test`.
4.  Analyze results.
5.  If all clear, confirm with the user and await guidance on MVP tasks.
