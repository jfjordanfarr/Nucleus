## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues and finalize GitHub Actions workflows.
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Finalize and validate GitHub Actions YAML (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`). (Build passed, but formatting/linting failed in CI)
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Ensure the `pr-validation.yml` workflow correctly handles conditional execution of integration tests (with `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` set to `false` for now) and uses simplified test filters.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Clarify GitHub secrets setup and environment variable sourcing in workflows, deciding on Environment Secrets.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Create/update the necessary workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Manage project branches: Stashed changes on `Dev`, checked out `main`, applied stash, created `develop` from `main`, and deleted `Dev`.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** User has set up GitHub Environment `ci_tests` with the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` secret.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Updated workflow files (`pr-validation.yml`, `release.yml`) to use the `ci_tests` environment.
    8.  **COMPLETED (Locally):** Resolved build issues in `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` by correcting project reference paths (to relative) and removing conflicting explicit package references, relying on transitive dependencies from `Nucleus.Services.Api.csproj`. Local `Debug` and `Release` builds and tests are now succeeding.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Resolved Git branch divergence on `develop` by having user `git pull --rebase origin develop` and then `git push origin develop`.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   User successfully rebased local `develop` on `origin/develop` and pushed changes.
    *   CI pipeline build step passed, but the `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` step failed with numerous "IMPORTS: Fix imports ordering" errors.
    *   Agent proposed setting `dotnet_separate_import_directive_groups = true` in `.editorconfig`, which user found introduced unwanted blank lines.
    *   Agent then proposed setting `dotnet_separate_import_directive_groups = false` to address the blank line issue.
    *   User committed `icon.png` to the repository root.
    *   User removed the `dotnet format` step from `pr-validation.yml` due to conflicts with preferred manual styling.
*   **Key Decisions Made (from previous tasks):**
    *   Sanitize or encode user input before logging by replacing newline characters.
*   **Key Decisions (Current Task - Inferred from User & Agent):**
    *   The project uses a `develop` branch for integration (PRs) and `main` for stable releases.
    *   Integration tests are controlled via the `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` environment variable.
    *   GitHub Actions are the primary means of CI/CD automation.
    *   `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` is explicitly set to `"false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
    *   Environment Secrets are used for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS`.
    *   `Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests.csproj` relies on transitive dependencies for ASP.NET Core and Logging types.
    *   The CI pipeline's `dotnet format` step was removed by the user to favor manual code styling.
*   **User Philosophy:** User strongly prefers human-driven code styling for readability and expressiveness, questioning the strict enforcement of automated style formatting (especially for non-critical rules) in the CI pipeline if it overrides human intent. Linting for quality/security is fine, but stylistic choices should be more flexible.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Resolve `dotnet test` errors in the CI pipeline. The errors indicate "invalid argument" for test DLL paths when `dotnet test` is run on the solution file (`./Nucleus.sln`) with a category filter (e.g., `Category=Integration`).
*   **Hypothesis:** The `dotnet test` command, when used with a solution file and a category filter, is incorrectly passing discovered test assembly paths to the underlying VSTest runner.
*   **Pending Actions (for GitHub Actions setup & Documentation):**
    1.  **ACTIVE AGENT TASK:** Modify the `pr-validation.yml` workflow to fix the `dotnet test` errors.
        *   For the "Run Integration Tests" step, target the specific integration test project (`.csproj`) directly instead of the solution file.
        *   Add diagnostic logging (`--diag`) to the test commands.
        *   Evaluate and potentially apply similar changes to the "Run Unit Tests" step if it uses a similar pattern and also fails.
    2.  **Future Task:** Enable full integration testing in `pr-validation.yml` (set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` to `true`).
    3.  **Future Task:** Enable Trivy security scanning in `release.yml`.
    4.  **Future Task:** Implement `release-drafter` or similar for automated release notes.
*   **Pending Actions (for the story and overall task - previously on hold, remains on hold):**
    1.  Read and analyze `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`.
    2.  Append analysis of `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` to the story.
    3.  Continue this process for all remaining key architectural documents.
    4.  Conclude the story with a summary and recommendations.
    5.  Await user guidance to transition to Core MVP tasks.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Current Git Branch:** `develop`
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
    *   Test project files (e.g., `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Integration/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests.csproj`)
    *   Test source files (e.g., `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Integration/Nucleus.Services.Api.IntegrationTests/InMemoryMessagingTests.cs` to check `TestCategory`)
*   **Files with CodeQL Alerts (previously addressed):**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs`
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised (on hold):** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Ongoing issues with integration test harness paths, leading to `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED` being set to `false` in `pr-validation.yml` for the time being.
*   CI pipeline is failing during the `dotnet test` step (specifically when filtering for `Category=Integration` at the solution level) with "invalid argument" errors for test DLLs.
*   The `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` step was removed from CI by the user.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User emphasizes quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User wants the AgentOps story to clearly and **factually** state AI developments and architectural findings.
*   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
*   Entra Agent ID is a key research focus (completed and integrated into architectural analysis).
*   Resolve CodeQL alerts by sanitizing logged user input (primarily by removing newlines).
*   GitHub Actions should leverage the existing integration test toggle in `NucleusConstants.cs`.
*   The project uses a `develop` branch (transitioned from `Dev` via `main`).
*   Goal is to make the project ready for AI-generated contributions via robust CI.
*   User has manually set `INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED: "false"` in `pr-validation.yml`'s `integration_test` job.
*   User wants to thoroughly scrutinize YAML files and understand secret management best practices.
*   User confirms the necessity of using a specific Google AI API key (implying Gemini) and will manage this via GitHub Secrets.
*   User enthusiastically agreed with "Option 3" for test categorization, which has now been implemented.
*   User brought uncommitted changes from `Dev` to `main` before creating `develop`.
*   User has decided to use GitHub Environment Secrets for the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_FOR_TESTS` and has set up an environment named `ci_tests` with the secret.
*   User confirms no releases are imminent and is interested in using GitHub Actions with conventional commits to automate release notes.
*   User has uploaded `icon.png` to the root of the repo.
*   User noted that Git operations feel more manual compared to Visual Studio's defaults.
*   User prefers their established coding style and disagrees with some "robotic" linting conventions, seeking to make CI less strict or align it with local preferences by making `.editorconfig` more explicit.
*   **User explicitly dislikes `dotnet format` adding/removing blank lines between `using` directive groups.**
*   **User values human-driven styling for readability and questions the strict enforcement of automated style formatting in CI if it overrides human intent.**
*   **User has removed the `dotnet format` step from the CI pipeline.**

## 8. Next Steps (Proposed)

1.  **Modify `pr-validation.yml`:**
    *   Change the "Run Integration Tests" step to target the specific integration test project directly (`.csproj`) instead of the solution file (`.sln`). Include the `--diag` flag for detailed logs.
    *   Review the "Run Unit Tests" step. If it uses a similar pattern (solution file + category filter), add the `--diag` flag. If it also fails, it will likely need a similar modification to target unit test projects directly or use a different strategy.
2.  **Commit and push changes** to trigger the CI pipeline and observe the results.
3.  **Analyze diagnostic logs** if tests still fail.
