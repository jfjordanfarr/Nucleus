## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Overall Task Definition

The primary goal is to resolve all CodeQL scan warnings and unit test failures in the Nucleus project. This includes addressing "Log entries created from user input" (completed), new "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" warnings (assessed as likely false positives), fixing unit test failures in `InteractionControllerTests.cs` (completed), and refining CI pipeline configurations (logger creation pattern addressed, CodeQL configuration mismatch under investigation and being actively addressed).

## 3. Current Task & Sub-Tasks

**Current Focus:** Resolve CodeQL branch protection issues by consolidating CodeQL workflows and correcting the language matrix to match historical expectations from the `main` branch.

*   **Overall Progress:**
    1.  **COMPLETED:** Resolve runtime DI errors in `Nucleus.AppHost`.
    2.  **COMPLETED:** Verify application startup.
    3.  **COMPLETED:** Initial manual fix for CodeQL "Log entries created from user input" warnings.
    4.  **COMPLETED:** Confirm CodeQL "Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source" warnings are in non-executable example files.
    5.  **COMPLETED:** Create `StringExtensions.cs` with `SanitizeLogInput` method.
    6.  **COMPLETED:** Implement global usings for `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Abstractions.Utils`.
    7.  **COMPLETED:** Refactor all identified files to use `SanitizeLogInput` extension method.
    8.  **COMPLETED:** Fix CI pipeline test results path for TRX logger.
    9.  **COMPLETED:** Address CI pipeline `System.UnauthorizedAccessException` for `/unit_test_diag.log` by adding a directory creation step.
    10. **COMPLETED:** Investigate and fix 9 unit test failures in `/workspaces/Nucleus/tests/Unit/Nucleus.Services.Api.Tests/Controllers/InteractionControllerTests.cs` by correcting `IActionResult` types in `InteractionController.cs`.
    11. **COMPLETED:** Investigate CodeQL warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` and `LocalAdapter.cs`. Assessed as likely false positives due to safe handling of data.
    12. **COMPLETED:** Address PR comment in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` regarding logger creation pattern.
    13. **COMPLETED:** Resolve CodeQL branch protection rule blocking merges due to configuration mismatches for `javascript-typescript` and `csharp` between `main` and `develop`/PR branches.
        *   **Action:** Modified `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` language matrix to `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`.
        *   **Action:** Removed redundant `security_code_scan` job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`.
    14. **COMPLETED:** Address CodeQL C# warnings: "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` by implementing `ModelState.IsValid` checks after adding data annotations to `AdapterRequest`.
    15. **REJECTED & REVISED/IN PROGRESS:** Refactor `LocalAdapter.cs` and `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput`.
        *   **Previous (Rejected):** Define a constant for "N/A" in `LocalAdapter.cs` and pass it to `SanitizeLogInput`.
        *   **Current Plan:** Modify `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput` to have its `defaultValue` parameter default to "N/A". Then, update calls in `LocalAdapter.cs` to be parameterless for `SanitizeLogInput` when "N/A" is the desired default.
    16. **PENDING:** User review and approval of all changes.
    17. **PENDING:** User re-run CodeQL scan and tests in CI to confirm all fixes, particularly on a PR to `main` to re-baseline expectations.

*   **Detailed Sub-Tasks (Current Focus):**
    *   **Refactor Logging Defaults:**
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Modify `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput` so its `defaultValue` parameter defaults to "N/A".
        *   **IN PROGRESS:** Update `LocalAdapter.cs` to call `SanitizeLogInput()` (parameterless) where "N/A" is the intended default for null/empty strings.
    *   **Address "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" CodeQL Warnings (Mostly Done for InteractionController):**
        *   **DONE:** Analyze warnings in `InteractionController.cs` and `LocalAdapter.cs`.
        *   **DONE:** Read relevant source files (`InteractionController.cs`, `LocalAdapter.cs`, `AdapterRequest.cs`, `PlatformType.cs`).
        *   **DONE:** Implemented fixes in `InteractionController.cs` using `ModelState.IsValid` and data annotations on `AdapterRequest`.
        *   **ASSESSMENT:** The warning in `LocalAdapter.cs` for `PersistInteractionAsync` is considered low risk due to upstream validation in `InteractionController.cs`, and the method's primary purpose being logging, not sensitive data processing that could be bypassed.
    *   **CodeQL Branch Protection Resolution & Workflow Consolidation (Mostly Done):**
        *   **DONE:** Analyze CodeQL workflow files (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `pr-validation.yml`) and compare with reported expectations from `main`.
        *   **DONE:** Modify `language` matrix in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`.
        *   **DONE:** Remove the `security_code_scan` job from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` to consolidate CodeQL analysis.
        *   **PENDING:** Advise on merging to `main` to re-baseline CodeQL expectations if issues persist after current PR.

## 4. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Turn Summary:** User confirmed that the change from `javascript` to `javascript-typescript` in `codeql.yml` was correct, but noted that `python` was inadvertently removed and they manually re-added it. The goal remains to consolidate CodeQL workflows.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Plan to consolidate CodeQL analysis into `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (Completed).
    *   The language matrix in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` is now `['csharp', 'javascript-typescript', 'python']`.
    *   Treated the "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" CodeQL warnings as genuine and requiring fixes (addressed in `InteractionController`).
    *   The `LocalAdapter.cs` CodeQL warning for `PersistInteractionAsync` is deemed sufficiently mitigated by controller-level validation for its current logging purpose.
    *   **REVISED:** Refactoring `SanitizeLogInput` to have "N/A" as its internal default for the `defaultValue` parameter, and making calls in `LocalAdapter.cs` parameterless when this default is desired.
*   **Search/Analysis Results:**
    *   `codeql.yml` now has the corrected language matrix.
    *   The CodeQL job in `pr-validation.yml` has been removed.
    *   CodeQL C# warnings for "User-controlled bypass of sensitive method" in `InteractionController.cs` have been addressed.
    *   Calls to `.SanitizeLogInput("N/A")` in `LocalAdapter.cs` need to be changed to `.SanitizeLogInput()`.
    *   The definition of `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput` needs to be checked and potentially modified.
*   **Pending User Feedback/Actions:**
    *   Review and approve proposed workflow changes (related to `pr-validation.yml` edit).
    *   Review and approve changes for CodeQL C# warnings in `InteractionController.cs` and `AdapterRequest.cs`.
    *   Review and approve upcoming refactoring of `StringExtensions.SanitizeLogInput` and `LocalAdapter.cs` for logging defaults.

## 5. Current Contextual Information

*   **User Instructions:** Adhere to Nucleus project mandate, quality over expedience, documentation as source code, context/cross-checking, persona-centric design, and core principles.
*   **Key Files for Current Task:**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Utils/StringExtensions.cs` (target for modifying `SanitizeLogInput` default parameter)
    *   `src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Adapters/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Adapters.Local/LocalAdapter.cs` (target for changing `SanitizeLogInput` calls to be parameterless)
    *   `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` (CodeQL fix applied)
    *   `src/Nucleus.Abstractions/Models/ApiContracts/AdapterRequest.cs` (Data annotations added)
*   **CodeQL Issue:** Merging blocked (previous issue mostly resolved by workflow consolidation). C# warnings in `InteractionController` addressed. `LocalAdapter` warning assessed. New focus on code style/DRY principle for logging defaults.

## 6. Agent's Scratchpad & Next Steps

1.  **Current Step:** Update this session state document.
2.  **Next Step:** Read `StringExtensions.cs` to check the current `SanitizeLogInput` method signature.
3.  **Then:** Propose changes to `StringExtensions.cs` to make the default value for `defaultValue` in `SanitizeLogInput` be "N/A".
4.  **Then:** Propose changes to `LocalAdapter.cs` to use parameterless calls to `SanitizeLogInput()`.
5.  **Future Steps:**
    *   Await user review and CI re-run.
    *   Advise on re-baselining `main` if necessary for general CodeQL workflow alignment.
