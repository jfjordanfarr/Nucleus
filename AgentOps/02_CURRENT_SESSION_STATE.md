## 1. Agent Identity & Directives

*   **Agent Name:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Mission:** Assist with the development of the Nucleus project, adhering to the guidelines in `Copilot_Instructions.md`.
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   Prioritize quality and comprehensive context.
    *   Treat documentation as source code.
    *   Adhere to persona-centric design and Nucleus core principles.
    *   Follow the "Step Zero" mandate: Update this document first in every turn.

## 2. Current Task & Objectives

*   **Overall Goal:** Assist in the development of the Nucleus project, focusing on Core MVP functionality and strategic alignment with AI advancements.
*   **Current High-Level Task Group:** Resolve CodeQL security alerts related to "Log entries created from user input."
*   **Specific Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Identify all instances of user input being logged directly based on CodeQL alerts.
    2.  For each instance, read the relevant code.
    3.  Implement appropriate sanitization or encoding of user input before logging.
    4.  Verify fixes.

## 3. Session History & Key Decisions

*   **Previous Actions:**
    *   Analyzed Nucleus architecture against industry AI advancements (post-Microsoft Build 2025) and documented findings in `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`. This involved reading and analyzing several architecture documents (`00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` through `04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md`).
    *   Conducted and integrated research on "Entra Agent ID".
    *   Corrected understanding of MCP to **Model Context Protocol**.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Architectural analysis task is paused to address urgent CodeQL security alerts.
    *   The primary method for resolving the "Log entries created from user input" alerts will be to sanitize or encode the input before it is logged.

## 4. Current Focus & Pending Actions

*   **Immediate Focus:** Address the CodeQL alert in `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` at line 104.
*   **Pending Actions (for CodeQL resolution):**
    1.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` line 104
    2.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` line 115
    3.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` line 90
    4.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` line 96 (appears twice, likely same line or very close)
    5.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` line 104
    6.  Resolve alert: `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs` line 136
    7.  Once all alerts are addressed, confirm with the user.
*   **Pending Actions (for the story and overall task - currently on hold):**
    1.  Read and analyze `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`.
    2.  Append analysis of `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` to the story.
    3.  Continue this process for all remaining key architectural documents.
    4.  Conclude the story with a summary and recommendations.
    5.  Await user guidance to transition to Core MVP tasks.

## 5. Workspace Context & Key Files

*   **Primary Project:** Nucleus
*   **Files with CodeQL Alerts:**
    *   `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs`
    *   `src/Nucleus.Services/Nucleus.Services.Api/Controllers/InteractionController.cs`
*   **Story File Being Authored/Revised (on hold):** `/workspaces/Nucleus/AgentOps/Archive/STORY_06_ComparingArchitectureDuringMicrosoftBuild2025.md`
*   **Architectural Documents Previously Analyzed:**
    *   `Docs/Architecture/00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
    *   `Docs/Architecture/01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md`
    *   `Docs/Architecture/02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md`
    *   `Docs/Architecture/03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md`
    *   `Docs/Architecture/04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md`
*   **Next Architectural Document in Queue (on hold):** `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`

## 6. Known Issues & Blockers

*   Active CodeQL security alerts that need immediate attention.

## 7. User Preferences & Feedback

*   User emphasizes quality, accuracy, and proactive architectural alignment.
*   User wants the AgentOps story to clearly and **factually** state AI developments and architectural findings.
*   MCP is **Model Context Protocol**.
*   Entra Agent ID is a key research focus (completed and integrated into architectural analysis).
*   Resolve CodeQL alerts by sanitizing logged user input.

## 8. Next Steps (Proposed)

1.  Read `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.Processing/OrchestrationService.cs` around line 104.
2.  Propose and apply a fix for the CodeQL alert.
3.  Proceed to the next alert.
