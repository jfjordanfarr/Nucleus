## Agent State

-   **Agent Version:** 1.3.0
-   **LLM Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via API)
-   **Current Operation:** MDMD Format Conversion - Converting docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan to MDMD format
-   **Current Focus Task:** Issue #11 - Convert docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan/ to MDMD.md format
-   **Action:** Transform documentation structure to match MDMD 2-strata pattern (Definition/Specification strata)
-   **Overall Progress:** Initial exploration and planning phase.

## MDMD Conversion Task Progress

### Task Understanding
- [x] Understand issue requirements: Convert docs/Architecture and docs/ProjectExecutionPlan to MDMD format
- [x] Review current documentation structure
- [ ] Research MDMD specification from referenced repository
- [ ] Analyze Open Sprunk Framework example for 2-strata pattern
- [ ] Plan conversion strategy (Definition vs Specification strata)
- [ ] Execute conversion with minimal changes to content

### Current Documentation Analysis
The current structure includes:
- docs/Architecture/ - Contains 9 main subdirectories with various .md files
- docs/ProjectExecutionPlan/ - Contains 10 .md files with requirements and tasks
- Current format uses standard markdown with YAML frontmatter

### Next Steps
1. Examine the MDMD specification pattern
2. Understand the 2-strata approach (Definition: Vision/Requirements, Specification: Concepts/Implementations)
3. Map current documents to appropriate strata
4. Perform conversion while preserving content integrity

## Agent Notes & Reminders:

-   Focus on understanding MDMD format before making any structural changes
-   Preserve all existing content and links during conversion
-   Follow the example pattern from Open Sprunk Framework
-   Ensure C# implementation remains unchanged as specified in the issue
-   Convert to 2-strata plan: Definition stratum (Vision/, Requirements/) and Specification stratum (Concepts/, Implementations/)
