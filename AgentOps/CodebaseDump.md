## 1 - Quality Over Expedience

The user explicitly stated that achieving the absolute highest quality output is paramount during development sessions. Cascade should prioritize internal consistency in documentation and design, and liberally use available tools (search, context, file viewing, editing, etc.) to ensure this high standard is met. Cost or resource usage of tools is not a primary constraint; quality is the goal. Treat architecture markdown files as rigorously as source code.

---

## 2 - Documentation as Source Code

The project uses a hierarchical documentation strategy:
1. Parent folders (e.g., `./Docs/Architecture/ClientAdapters/`) contain overview documents for major concepts (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS.md`) and documents defining common elements applicable to siblings (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md`).
2. If an overview concept needs detailed breakdown across multiple files, a sub-folder matching the overview file's base name (e.g., `Teams/`) is created within the parent folder.
3. Detailed breakdown markdown files are placed inside the corresponding sub-folder (e.g., `./Docs/Architecture/ClientAdapters/Teams/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS_INTERFACES.md`).
4. Overview documents may be refined to summarize and link to the detailed documents in their sub-folders.

After making any edits to a Markdown documentation file within the Nucleus project, always perform a quick verification check to ensure:
1.  The metadata header (title, description, version, date) is present, accurate, and up-to-date.
2.  All internal links within the document (both relative and potentially absolute) point to the correct locations and are still relevant given the changes made.
3.  The document links correctly back to its parent overview document(s) and down to any specific child/detailed documents as per the hierarchical documentation strategy.
This helps prevent broken links and outdated metadata, maintaining the integrity and navigability of the documentation.

To enhance maintainability and facilitate agentic AI development within the Nucleus codebase, a strategy of tight cross-linking between code and documentation should be employed. Code comments (especially XML comments in C#) should reference relevant architecture or design documents (e.g., using markdown links or file paths). Conversely, documentation files (Markdown) should include links (e.g., relative paths or `cci:` URIs) pointing to the specific code files, classes, or methods they describe. This ensures that context is easily discoverable whether starting from the code or the documentation.

### Observations and Notes

The user's pushback against the proposed Office processor and the subsequent refinement of the LLM-synthesis approach highlighted a key aspect of the desired development methodology. Architectural Markdown documents are treated with the rigor of source code, demanding internal consistency and adherence to core principles (like simplicity and LLM-first). My role involves proposing solutions, but critically, also rapidly adapting to corrective feedback. User pushback serves not just to correct a specific point, but to reinforce the overall vision and ensure I actively use tools and context to maintain the high standard of quality and consistency required in the documentation, effectively co-authoring the system design.

## 3 - LLM Tool Usage During Agentic Development

The `edit_file` tool modifies existing files. Key guidelines:
1.  **Atomicity:** Aim to combine ALL related changes (even across different sections like CSS, HTML, JS) into a SINGLE `edit_file` call for atomicity and consistency.
2.  **Precision:** Specify ONLY the precise lines of code to change.
3.  **Placeholder:** NEVER write out unchanged code. ALWAYS represent unchanged lines/blocks with the special placeholder: `{{ ... }}`.
4.  **Multiple Edits:** For non-adjacent edits within the same file, use `{{ ... }}` to represent the unchanged code between the edited sections within the single `CodeEdit` string.
5.  **Formatting Challenges:** Complex single-call edits involving multiple sections are more prone to JSON formatting errors (e.g., incorrect escaping, quoting). Meticulous validation of the `CodeEdit` string's structure is critical.
6.  **Fallback (Use Sparingly):** If persistent JSON errors block a complex single-call edit, consider breaking it into smaller, logically grouped sequential `edit_file` calls as a fallback. However, prioritize the single atomic edit whenever feasible.
7.  **Arguments:** Provide `CodeMarkdownLanguage`, a clear `Instruction`, the `TargetFile` (as the first argument), and optional `TargetLintErrorIds`.

When using the `edit_file` tool:
1.  **Robust Content Injection:** For injecting dynamic content (especially potentially complex strings like code or JSON) into files (e.g., HTML templates), prefer server-side encoding (like `HtmlEncode`) and client-side decoding. Avoid relying solely on client-side string manipulation/escaping for robustness, as inputs might vary unexpectedly.
2.  **Large File Edits:** Be mindful of file size. Edits involving very large code blocks (e.g., > ~700 lines in an HTML/JS context) might risk timing out during generation or application. Consider strategies like breaking down large edits or ensuring the generation process is efficient for large content blocks if necessary.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Editing often requires iteration. If an initial approach (like simple JS escaping) proves insufficient, pivot to more robust methods (like `HtmlEncode`) based on testing and feedback.

## 4 - Development Insights Worth Saving

### Insight 1

A key learning moment occurred when the user rejected the proposal for a dedicated 'Office Document Processor'. Instead, the user mandated a simpler approach: the File Collections processor aggregates raw components (XML, LLM-generated media descriptions), and the Plaintext processor uses its LLM, given the entire bundle in context, to synthesize the final, single Markdown document. This revealed a core design principle: avoid creating specialized, complex processors if the task can be delegated to an LLM acting as a 'common sense engine' with sufficient context. The Plaintext processor's role was thus elevated from a simple converter to a powerful synthesizer.

### Insight 2

Processing, especially LLM-driven synthesis, will inherently produce non-deterministic Markdown outputs. This is acceptable and expected. The system should NOT attempt to enforce idempotency by hashing the final Markdown output. Instead, idempotency relies on source artifact identifiers (source ID, content hash of source, timestamps) and context (Persona version). Furthermore, the system should embrace fuzziness by allowing Markdown string literals within metadata fields (like ArtifactMetadata, PersonaKnowledgeEntry) where precise structure is less important than rich, nuanced description, leveraging the LLM's native understanding of Markdown.

### Insight 3

The user prefers an initial deployment architecture consisting of a single Azure Container App (ACA) instance acting as a 'modular monolith'. This single ACA should host the API/ClientAdapters, ingestion/triage logic, session management (in-memory), and the core processing logic (potentially run as background tasks within the same instance). This minimizes deployment complexity and avoids the need for external session state management (like Redis) initially. The supporting infrastructure should ideally be limited to one Cosmos DB instance and potentially one Azure Service Bus (primarily for external integration or future scaling needs, not essential for the core internal processing flow). Components should be designed modularly within the monolith to allow for future separation and independent scaling if required.

# AgentOps Methodology for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

## Introduction

This document outlines the AgentOps methodology for AI-assisted development used in the Nucleus OmniRAG project. Following this process helps maintain context, track progress, and ensure efficient collaboration between human developers/leads and AI assistants within the .NET/Azure ecosystem, specifically targeting Azure Cosmos DB as the backend and supporting multiple AI Personas. This methodology also serves as a framework for generating high-quality training data for future AI development agents.

## Core Principles

1.  **Stateful Context Management**: Using dedicated documents (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, `/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) to preserve context. Accurate state tracking is paramount for effective collaboration and training data generation.
2.  **Incremental Progress Tracking**: Breaking work into manageable tasks (Kanban) and tracking the immediate focus (Session State).
3.  **Structured Collaboration**: AI assistants use the provided state documents to understand the current focus and assist with the defined "Next Step", following specific VS Code interaction patterns. Human leads provide guidance, feedback, and validation.
4.  **Continuous Documentation**: Updating state documents in real-time as progress is made or issues arise. **AI assistance in keeping these updated is expected and crucial for training data quality.**
5.  **Architectural Adherence**: Development must align with the architecture summarized in `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Cosmos DB backend, external orchestrator, multi-persona interaction model). Emphasize SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`).
6.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Aim to write tests (Unit, Integration) before or alongside implementation where practical. Define test cases as part of task definitions.
7.  **Distinguish Process Types:** Be mindful of the difference between "Slow Processes" (asynchronous, potentially long-running tasks like ingestion analysis by multiple personas) and "Fast Processes" (low-latency operations like chat responses or tool calls). Design components appropriately.
8.  **Persona Interaction & Deduplication:** Recognize that personas can interact (especially during ingestion to determine salience) and that mechanisms to prevent duplicate data ingestion are necessary.

## Roles of Key AgentOps Files

*   **`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`**: The "Why". Understand the motivation and high-level vision.
*   **`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: The "What". Provides stable, high-level technical context: goals, .NET/Azure/Cosmos DB tech stack, architectural summary (including persona interaction model), links to detailed docs.
*   **`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**: The "Now". Captures the **microstate**. Dynamic and updated frequently. Details the *specific task*, *last action*, relevant *C# code*, *errors/blockers*, and the *immediate next step*. **This is your primary focus.** Accuracy here is key for training data.
*   **`03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`**: The "Where". Captures the **macrostate**. Tracks overall progress of features/tasks. Updated less frequently.

## Workflow Process

1.  **Session Start:** Developer/Lead shares `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` (and potentially others) with the AI. AI reviews state, context (`01`, Mandate), and plan (`03`).
2.  **Task Execution:** Focus on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`. AI assists with C# code generation, debugging, analysis, Azure SDK usage, test generation, etc.
3.  **Code Insertion:** When providing code changes in markdown blocks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block and explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.**
4.  **State Update:** After completing a step, applying a code insertion, encountering an error, or shifting focus, the developer/lead (with AI help) **updates `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**. This step is critical for maintaining context and generating useful training data.
5.  **Kanban Update:** When a Kanban task progresses, the developer/lead (with AI help) updates `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Archiving:** Periodically, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` is moved to `Archive/`, and a new one is started.

## "Nagging Thoughts" for AI Assistants (Critical Instructions for .NET/Azure/VS Code)

To ensure effectiveness and avoid common pitfalls, please constantly consider:

1.  **Check for Existing Work / Verify File Existence:** Before creating a file/class/interface, ask: "Does something similar already exist according to the project structure (`01`), existing code, or Kanban (`03`)?" **To verify file existence, DO NOT rely on VS Code Search. Propose or ask the developer to use a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`).**
2.  **Avoid Placeholder Workarounds & Technical Debt:** Don't settle for quick fixes or workarounds when facing obstacles. These often persist as difficult-to-debug technical debt long after they leave your context window. When there's a "right way" (e.g., using proper Microsoft.Extensions.AI interfaces or DotNet Aspire patterns), invest time to implement it correctly from the start, even if it requires several attempts or additional research. This project is intended for production use; take time to research proper implementation patterns via web search when facing integration challenges rather than creating improvised solutions. Remember that each technical compromise made for expediency creates a hidden cost for future maintainers.
3.  **Aim for Robust Solutions:** Ask: "Is this a temporary patch, or does it address the root cause robustly? Does it align with SOLID principles, use DI correctly, handle asynchronicity properly (`async`/`await`), and utilize Azure SDKs (`azure-cosmos`) according to best practices (client lifetime, partitioning, error handling, vector indexing configuration)?"
4.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Ask: "Is this the clearest and simplest C# code? Are interfaces being used effectively?"
5.  **Use Correct CLI Commands:** Ensure correct `dotnet`, `az` commands. **For PowerShell, prefer chaining with `;`.**
6.  **Use "Insert in Editor" Correctly:** Provide complete code blocks. **Always remind the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** Do not assume changes are applied unless confirmed.
7.  **Update State Documents:** After providing code, analysis, or after developer confirms applying changes, remind/propose updates for `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and potentially `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`. This is vital for session continuity and training data.
8.  **Consider Multi-Persona Interaction:** How might this component be used or triggered by different personas? Does the data model support storing persona-specific insights (e.g., the `analysis` field within `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`)?
9.  **Slow vs. Fast Processes:** Is this part of ingestion (likely slow, asynchronous) or query handling (likely fast, synchronous API)? Choose appropriate patterns.
10. **Deduplication:** During ingestion-related tasks, ask: "How will we prevent processing the exact same artifact multiple times? Should we add checks based on `ArtifactMetadata` properties (like `sourceUri` and potentially a content hash) or use the `sourceIdentifier`?"
11. **Troubleshooting Build Issues:** When encountering build errors:
    - **Project Structure Issues:** Check for parent-child project conflicts in nested directories. A parent project (e.g., `Nucleus.Personas.csproj`) with subprojects in subdirectories (e.g., `EduFlow/EduFlow.csproj`) needs proper exclusions:
      ```xml
      <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Remove="SubDir\**" />
        <EmbeddedResource Remove="SubDir\**" />
        <None Remove="SubDir\**" />
        <Content Remove="SubDir\**" />
      </ItemGroup>
      ```
    - **Missing Namespaces:** Remember that interfaces may be in specialized sub-namespaces (e.g., `Nucleus.Abstractions.Services.Retrieval`) requiring explicit imports.
    - **Constructor Parameters:** When updating interfaces or implementations, check all dependent test files for mock setup requirements and expected property names.
    - **Method Name Mismatches:** Verify exact method and class names in extension method calls (e.g., `builder.Services.AddNucleusInfrastructure(builder.Configuration)` vs. `builder.AddInfrastructureServices()`).
    - **Project References:** Ensure all necessary projects are referenced, particularly when working with test projects that need access to interfaces.

By adhering to this methodology and keeping these "nagging thoughts" in mind, you will significantly contribute to the successful development of Nucleus OmniRAG and help train more effective AI development assistants.

**Attention AI Assistant:** This document provides high-level context for the .NET/Azure implementation using Azure Cosmos DB. Refer to `/docs/` for full details and the Project Mandate (`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) for motivation.

**Version:** 1.7
**Date:** 2025-04-09

## Vision & Goal

*   **Vision:** Build the Nucleus OmniRAG infrastructure for knowledge work enhanced by contextual AI, adaptable across domains via specialized "Personas" (EduFlow, Business Knowledge Assistant, etc.), seamlessly integrated into users' existing workflows via **platform bots/apps (Teams, Slack, Discord, Email)**. See `/docs/Requirements/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`.
*   **Initial Goal (Phase 1 MVP):** Implement a minimal viable product using the **.NET AI Chat App template** as a foundation. Focus on direct user interaction with the initial `BootstrapperPersona` via the template's Blazor WebAssembly chat interface and **ASP.NET Core WebAPI** backend. Integrate basic knowledge storage (Cosmos DB) and retrieval.

## Key Technologies

*   **Language:** C# (using .NET 9.0)
*   **Core Framework:** Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET Solution), **.NET AI Chat App Template** (Foundation for P1)
*   **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure (Primary target for hosting)
*   **Primary Backend (Knowledge Store):** **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Integrated Vector Search)** - Stores `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents.
*   **Primary Backend (Metadata Store):** **Azure Blob Storage (Metadata or Separate Files)** - Stores `ArtifactMetadata` objects (Less critical for P1 Chat focus).
*   **Key Azure Services:** Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, **Azure AI Search**, **Azure OpenAI Service**, Service Bus, Functions (v4+ Isolated Worker - for later phases), Key Vault.
*   **AI Provider:** **Azure OpenAI Service** (Primary for Template, via `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`), Google Gemini AI (Secondary/Future).
*   **Platform Integration (Phase 2+):** Microsoft Bot Framework SDK / Graph API (Teams), Slack Bolt/API, Discord.NET/API, Email Processing (e.g., MailKit/MimeKit).
*   **MVP UI (Phase 1):** **Blazor WebAssembly** (from Chat Template)
*   **MVP API (Phase 1):** **ASP.NET Core WebAPI** (Replacing Template's Minimal API)
*   **Development:** Git, VS Code / Windsurf, .NET SDK 9.x, NuGet, **DotNet Aspire** (9.2), xUnit, Moq/NSubstitute, TDD focus.
*   **AI Abstractions:** **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** (`IChatClient`, `IEmbeddingGenerator`), **Semantic Kernel** (Used by Chat Template).
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (Optional/Later):** Bicep / Terraform.

## Architecture Snapshot (Phase 1 - Chat Template Focus)

*   **Interaction:** Users interact directly with the **Blazor WASM UI** provided by the .NET AI Chat App template.
*   **Frontend:** Blazor WebAssembly application.
*   **Backend Core:** .NET 9 / Aspire
    *   **API Endpoints (`Nucleus.Api` - adapted from Template):** **ASP.NET Core WebAPI** handling requests from the Blazor frontend. Orchestrates interaction with AI services and potentially the `BootstrapperPersona`.
    *   **AI Integration (Template):** Leverages Azure OpenAI for chat completion and Azure AI Search for RAG, orchestrated by Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Persona Implementations (`Nucleus.Personas.*`):** Initial `BootstrapperPersona` needs to be integrated into the template's flow (e.g., potentially as a Semantic Kernel plugin/function or invoked by the API).
    *   **Database (`Nucleus.Infrastructure`):** Adapters (`IPersonaKnowledgeRepository`) for Cosmos DB to store/retrieve persona-generated knowledge (if needed for the simple `BootstrapperPersona` in P1).
    *   *Note: Platform Adapters, complex Orchestration, Metadata Service, File Storage are deferred to Phase 2+.*
*   **Data Flow (Phase 1 - Chat):**
    1.  User types message in **Blazor WASM UI**.
    2.  UI sends request to **Backend API**.
    3.  API uses Semantic Kernel and configured AI services (Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search) to process the request. This may involve:
        *   Retrieving relevant context (RAG) from Azure AI Search (or potentially our Cosmos DB via `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository` later).
        *   Invoking the `BootstrapperPersona` logic.
        *   Calling Azure OpenAI for chat completion.
    4.  API streams response back to the **Blazor WASM UI**.
*   **Deployment Model (P1):** Azure App Service / Azure Container Apps.
*   **Core Principles:** Leverage template structure, adapt template components, integrate `BootstrapperPersona` logic, defer complex Nucleus architecture.

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

*   Building a full-featured standalone chat application *from scratch* in Phase 1 (Leveraging template instead).
*   Implementing platform adapters (Email, Teams, etc.) in Phase 1.
*   Storing original user files in Phase 1.
*   Complex workflow orchestration in Phase 1.

## Current Focus / Next Steps (High Level)

1.  **Set up .NET AI Chat App Template (`ISSUE-MVP-TEMPLATE-01`):** Install SDK/template, create initial project based on it.
2.  **Configure Aspire (`TASK-MVP-TMPL-02`):** Integrate the template projects (`WebApp`, `Api`) into the Aspire AppHost for local development with emulators/dependencies.
3.  **Adapt Template (`TASK-MVP-TMPL-03`+):** Configure template to use required Azure services (Cosmos DB for `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository` if needed, Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI), update UI/API as necessary.
4.  **Integrate `BootstrapperPersona` (`ISSUE-MVP-PERSONA-01`):** Implement the basic Bootstrapper logic and connect it to the API/Semantic Kernel flow.
5.  **Implement Basic Knowledge Storage/Retrieval (`ISSUE-MVP-RETRIEVAL-01`):** If Bootstrapper needs persistent knowledge, implement `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository` using Cosmos DB and integrate retrieval.

## 🔄 Session Info

*   **Date:** `2025-04-11`
*   **Time:** `20:44 UTC-4` *(Approximate time of state update)*
*   **Developer:** `jfjordanfarr` (Lead)

## 🎯 Active Task (from Kanban)

*   **ID/Name:** `TASK-MVP-ARCH-01`: Pivot to Console App MVP
*   **Goal:** Update project structure, architecture documents, and AppHost configuration to reflect the shift from a Blazor WebApp frontend to a Console Application (`Nucleus.Console`) as the primary MVP interaction point.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus / Micro-Goal

*   Refactor architecture documentation and AppHost configuration to align with the Console App MVP strategy.

---

## ⏪ Last Action(s) Taken

*   **Added `Nucleus.Console` Project:** Created a new .NET Console App project (`src/Nucleus.Console`) and added it to `NucleusOmniRAG.sln`.
*   **Updated `00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`:** Revised overview doc (`docs/Architecture/`) to reflect Console App MVP.
*   **Renamed/Rewrote `05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`:** Renamed from `_FRONTEND` (`docs/Architecture/`) and rewrote content to focus on Console App architecture, command structure, and future platform integration.
*   **Updated `Nucleus.AppHost\Program.cs`:** Removed definition of `webApp` project. Confirmed `consoleApp` is defined and referenced correctly (`AddProject<Projects.Nucleus_Console>`). Removed reference to Functions project (commented out).
*   **Updated `Nucleus.AppHost.csproj`:** Removed `ProjectReference` for `Nucleus.WebApp` and `Nucleus.Functions`. Added `ProjectReference` for `Nucleus.Console`.
*   **Ran `dotnet restore`:** Restored packages for `Nucleus.AppHost` after `.csproj` changes.

---

## ❗ Current Error / Blocker (if any)

*   None directly related to the current task. Build warnings (`MSB4011` - SDK import duplication) were observed during `dotnet restore` but did not prevent completion. Existing lint errors in `Nucleus.Api` and `Nucleus.AppHost` (missing namespaces/types before restore) should now be resolved, but verification via build is pending.

---

## ▶️ Immediate Next Step

1.  **Update Kanban Board:** Move `TASK-MVP-ARCH-01` (or a relevant sub-task like updating AppHost/Docs) to 'Done' on `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
2.  **Update Other Docs:** Review and update other potentially affected documents in `docs/Planning/` and `docs/Requirements/` to reflect the Console App MVP approach.
3.  **Build Solution:** Run `dotnet build` on the solution to verify the AppHost changes and ensure no new build errors were introduced.

---

## ❓ Open Questions / Verification Needed

*   Are there other documents in `docs/Planning` or `docs/Requirements` that need immediate updates due to the Console App pivot?

## 📊 Development Philosophy Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement basic functionality first, then iteratively refine and expand capabilities.
2. **Continuous Experimentation**: Artifact interpretation and meaning extraction will require ongoing experimentation and refinement over years.
3. **Persona-Centric Design**: Processing approaches should adapt to the specialized knowledge and needs of different personas.
4. **Contextual Relevance**: Personas determine and extract relevant knowledge based on the artifact and their domain.
5. **Flexible Architecture**: Design systems that can evolve as AI capabilities and our understanding of effective meaning extraction improve.

```markdown
# AgentOps for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

**Attention AI Assistant:** This folder contains critical context for developing the Nucleus OmniRAG platform and its Personas (EduFlow, HealthSpecialist, etc.) using .NET and Azure, with Azure Cosmos DB as the primary backend. Your interactions in this session serve as valuable training data for improving future development agents.

## Purpose

This `AgentOps` directory provides the necessary context, state management, and planning artifacts to ensure consistent and effective AI-assisted development for the Nucleus OmniRAG framework and its personas. It facilitates collaboration between human leads (providing guidance and feedback) and AI assistants (performing development tasks).

## How to Use These Files (Instructions for AI Assistant)

1.  **Start Here:** Always begin by reading `00_START_HERE_METHODOLOGY.md` to understand the development process, your role, the importance of state management for training data, and specific collaboration tips for VS Code. Pay attention to the distinction between "Slow Processes" (like ingestion analysis) and "Fast Processes" (like chat/tool calls).
2.  **Understand Context:** Review `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the project vision (including multi-persona goals and interactions), core requirements, key technologies (.NET/Azure/Cosmos DB), and a summary of the architecture. Refer to the Project Mandate (`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) for motivation. Note the plan for persona interaction during ingestion and the need for deduplication.
3.  **Check Current State:** Read `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` carefully. This tells you *exactly* what task is active, what was just done, any errors encountered, and the immediate next step. **This is your primary focus for the current interaction.**
4.  **See the Big Picture:** Refer to `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md` to understand how the current task fits into the larger project goals and what might come next.
5.  **Update State:** As you help complete steps or encounter issues, **it is crucial that you assist the developer/lead in updating `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**. Clear state tracking is vital for effective collaboration and for the quality of the training data generated from this session. When a Kanban task progresses, help update `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Use Templates:** When starting a new session state snapshot, use `Templates/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`.
7.  **Avoid Duplication / Verify Files:** Before creating new files or implementing features, check the project structure (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`) and Kanban (`03`). **Crucially, if you need to verify if a file exists, DO NOT rely solely on the VS Code Search tool. Instead, ask the developer to confirm using a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`) or propose such a command.**
8.  **Leverage "Insert in Editor":** When providing code modifications or new code blocks within markdown backticks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block without placeholders like `// ...`**. Then, **explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** This ensures the complete code is applied correctly before subsequent steps are attempted and provides clear action steps for the training data.

Your primary goal is to assist the developer/lead in making progress on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, within the context provided by the other documents, using C# and relevant Azure SDKs/patterns, following the collaboration guidelines above. Remember, clarity and accuracy in your actions and state updates contribute directly to building better AI development assistants.

## AgentOps/Archive/EduFlowDataModelProposals.md

```markdown
# EduFlow OmniEducator Data Model Proposals

## Introduction

This document outlines proposed data models for the EduFlow OmniEducator persona within the Nucleus OmniRAG framework. The primary goals driving these models are:

1.  **Capture Authentic Learning:** Model the richness of learning that occurs through diverse activities, especially digital creation, exploration, and project-based work.
2.  **Dual-Lens Classification:** Incorporate both foundational learning capabilities (the "tautological" view focused on *how* learning happens) and traditional pedagogical knowledge domains (the "pedagogical" view focused on *what* is learned) for comprehensive understanding and mapping.
3.  **Connect to Standards:** Facilitate the mapping of observed learning evidence to relevant educational benchmarks and curriculum standards.
4.  **Support Rich Interaction & Reporting:** Provide the necessary structure for insightful reporting, personalized feedback, AI-driven analysis, and interactive learning experiences (supporting both "fast path" and "slow path" services).
5.  **Flexibility:** Accommodate different ages, learning styles, cultural contexts, and the evolving nature of learning itself.

These models are designed to work together, creating a network of information that reflects a learner's journey and capabilities.

## Relationships Summary

*   A **Learner** engages in **Activities**, producing **Artifacts** and pursuing **Goals**.
*   **Activities** generate **Artifacts** and relate to **Goals**.
*   **Artifacts** are the core evidence, linked to the **Activity**, **Learner**, and potentially classified against **Skills**, **Domains**, and **Standards**.
*   **Skills** and **KnowledgeDomains** form hierarchical structures (representing both pedagogical subjects and foundational capabilities via `tree_type`) and relate to **Standards**.
*   **Assessments** evaluate **Activities** or **Artifacts** against criteria (often related to **Skills** or **Standards**).
*   **Feedback** can be provided on **Activities**, **Artifacts**, or **Assessments**.
*   **EduFlowAnalysis** provides automated analysis of **Artifacts**, suggesting links to **Skills**, **Domains**, and **Standards**.

## Usage Scenarios Example: Documenting a Scratch Project

1.  **Learner** starts a new **LearningActivity** (Type: `Project`, Title: "Water Cycle Simulation").
2.  As they work, **LearningArtifacts** are captured (Type: `Code` for Scratch JSON, Type: `Video` for screencast, Type: `Text` for project description).
3.  The EduFlow persona (via **EduFlowAnalysis**) analyzes the `Code` artifact:
    *   Extracts `keywords`: "loop", "variable", "if/else", "evaporation", "coordinates".
    *   Suggests `Skill` IDs: "Algorithmic Thinking", "Debugging", "Using Variables".
    *   Suggests `KnowledgeDomain` IDs: "Mathematics" (Pedagogical), "Technology" (Pedagogical), "Mathematical & Logical Reasoning" (Foundational), "Creative Expression & Design" (Foundational), "Sciences" (Pedagogical - due to topic).
    *   Suggests `Standard` alignment based on keywords and detected skills/domains.
4.  Learner/Educator adds manual tags or confirms AI suggestions on the **LearningArtifact**.
5.  Later, an **Assessment** (Type: `PortfolioReview`) might look at multiple **LearningArtifacts** (referencing their metadata) from this activity. The reviewer (human or AI) could retrieve the corresponding `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents containing the **EduFlowAnalysis** for each artifact to evaluate specific **Skills** or progress towards a **Goal**.
6.  **Feedback** might be given by the AI (based on its **EduFlowAnalysis**) or an educator.

## Future Considerations

*   **Collaboration:** More detailed modeling of collaborative roles and contributions within activities.
*   **Context:** Richer context capture (location, tools used beyond artifact type, emotional state).
*   **External Tool Integration:** Specific models for data ingested from platforms like Scratch, Minecraft, Khan Academy, etc.
*   **Learning Pathways:** Modeling sequences of activities or suggested learning paths.
*   **Granularity:** Finer-grained representation of artifact components (e.g., specific code blocks, video segments).

This proposed structure provides a robust foundation for capturing and interpreting learning within the EduFlow OmniEducator persona, balancing the need for structured data with the flexibility required for authentic, project-based education.

```markdown
Nearly all children everywhere on planet earth receive an education while they are growing up. While every place in the world has different curricula, there exist a set of core pedagogical subjects. What I want you to do is reason deeply across all of your multicultural and multilingual understanding as to what these core pedagogical subjects are, such that we might begin the first branches of an eventual pedagogical tree of teachable knowledge. This output is in service of building EduFlow OmniEducator, a new AI powered homeschooling app in progress. Here is a little context about that:

# The Nucleus Project: Our Vision and Mission

## Why We're Building This

The Nucleus project emerged from a deeply personal origin - a parent's journey to create a better educational experience for their child. When exploring homeschooling options for their 5-year-old, they discovered a critical gap in educational technology: **existing platforms fail to support and document authentic learning that happens through digital creation and self-directed projects**.

> "My gut reaction was 'well, I guess we gotta code a platform to do this ourselves!' Personally surprised at the absence of more platforms trying to comprehensively do homeschooling in a regio emilia/project-directed fashion leveraging AI/games."

Traditional educational software follows rigid, linear paths disconnected from children's actual interests. Meanwhile, children demonstrate remarkable learning through:
- Programming in Scratch
- Building virtual reality environments
- Creating digital music
- Modifying games

Yet these rich learning experiences often go undocumented and unconnected to educational standards - creating a challenge for parents who need to demonstrate progress while fostering authentic engagement.

## Our Mission

**Nucleus is building the infrastructure for knowledge work enhanced by contextual AI** - starting with education but extending to any domain where specialized knowledge interpretation matters.

We're creating:

**Nucleus OmniRAG**: A flexible framework for knowledge retrieval, processing, and augmentation that adapts to specific domains through "personas" - specialized lenses that interpret the same knowledge in domain-specific ways.

## The Persona Model

At the heart of Nucleus OmniRAG is the persona model - our approach to domain specialization:

1. **What is a Persona?** A persona is a specialized lens through which knowledge is ingested, labeled, interpreted, and retrieved. It includes domain-specific:
   - Schemas and collections
   - Prompt templates
   - Processing workflows
   - Retrieval strategies
   - Business logic

2. **Multiple Personas, One Knowledge Core**: The same underlying knowledge can be interpreted differently by different personas:
   - The **EduFlow** persona might view a programming project as evidence of mathematical reasoning skills
   - A **Healthcare** persona might interpret health journal entries as symptoms to track
   - A **Knowledge Management** persona might organize information by project or topic

3. **Personas as Services**: Each persona represents a valuable service that can be offered independently or in combination:
   - Open source core, with commercial personas
   - Subscription access to specialized personas
   - Custom persona development for specific domains

## Our Initial Focus: EduFlow

Our first implemented persona is EduFlow OmniEducator - our original inspiration. This education-focused persona:

1. **Documents Authentic Learning**: Captures and organizes evidence of learning from digital creation and exploration
2. **Connects to Standards**: Maps organic learning to educational benchmarks and requirements
3. **Personalizes Education**: Adapts to individual interests while ensuring comprehensive coverage
4. **Supports Project-Based Learning**: Provides structure for self-directed exploration
5. **Integrates Digital and Physical**: Bridges digital creation with real-world experiences

## Dual Modality Architecture

Our dual modality architecture reflects our mission:

- **Interactive Services** (Fast Path): Enabling real-time exploration, questions, and feedback during active learning or knowledge work
- **Processing Services** (Slow Path): Connecting disparate knowledge artifacts, ingesting multimodal data, and building contextual understanding over time

This architecture serves as the foundation for all personas within the system.

## Beyond Education

While education is our starting point, the persona model allows Nucleus to expand into other domains:

- **Healthcare**: Personal health knowledge integration and contextual health insights
- **Research**: Tracking and connecting research threads across multiple sources
- **Knowledge Work**: Organizing and retrieving professional knowledge contextualized by project
- **Creative Projects**: Supporting creative endeavors with relevant context and inspiration

Each domain benefits from the same core technology but with specialized interpretation and presentation.

## The Open Source Approach

Our commitment to open source reflects our vision:

1. **Open Core**: The Nucleus OmniRAG framework will be open source, allowing anyone to build on our foundation
2. **Open Persona Interface**: The mechanism for creating new personas will be open and documented
3. **Commercial Personas**: Specialized personas may be offered commercially to support ongoing development
4. **Hosted Option**: A managed service for those who want the technology without the operational complexity

This hybrid approach allows us to build sustainable technology while maximizing accessibility and impact.

## Looking Forward

Through Nucleus OmniRAG, we envision a world where:

- Knowledge is fluid and contextual rather than rigid and siloed
- Domain expertise is encoded in personas that can be shared and combined
- The same information can serve multiple purposes through different interpretative lenses
- People can work more effectively with their own knowledge across different parts of their lives

As we continue to develop Nucleus OmniRAG using our AgentOps methodology, we remain focused on this core purpose: **building the infrastructure for contextual knowledge work that adapts to human needs across domains**.

Okay, this is a fascinating and crucial task for building the foundation of EduFlow OmniEducator. Identifying the truly *core* pedagogical subjects that form the trunk and first major branches of a universal knowledge tree requires looking past specific national curricula and focusing on the fundamental domains of human knowledge and skill acquisition essential for development, regardless of culture.

Based on a cross-cultural understanding and commonalities in educational systems worldwide, here are the proposed core pedagogical subject domains, designed to serve as the initial high-level classification schema for EduFlow:

Based on the search results and a synthesis of global educational practices, here are the core pedagogical subject domains:

1.  **Language and Literacy (Native Language):** This is universally fundamental. It encompasses learning to read, write, speak, and comprehend the primary language of instruction. This includes literature, composition, grammar, and communication skills. It's the bedrock upon which most other learning is built. (Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24)

2.  **Mathematics:** Another universal core subject, focusing on numeracy, logical reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding quantitative relationships. This domain includes arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics/probability, and foundational concepts for more advanced study. (Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24)

3.  **Sciences (Natural and Physical):** This domain involves understanding the physical and natural world. It typically includes biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, and astronomy, often integrated at earlier stages (e.g., "General Science," "Environmental Studies"). It emphasizes inquiry, observation, experimentation, and understanding scientific principles. (Sources: 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 24)

4.  **Social Sciences and Humanities:** This broad area focuses on understanding human societies, cultures, history, and interactions. It commonly includes:
    *   **History:** Understanding past events and their impact. (Sources: 1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 20, 24)
    *   **Geography:** Understanding the Earth's physical features, climate, and human populations. (Sources: 1, 11, 13, 15)
    *   **Civics/Social Studies/Citizenship:** Understanding government, societal structures, rights, responsibilities, and cultural norms. (Sources: 1, 2, 3, 11, 15, 16, 18, 23)
    *   Often includes elements of economics, philosophy, ethics, and world religions depending on the level and system. (Sources: 1, 2, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20)

5.  **The Arts:** While the specific disciplines vary (visual arts, music, drama, dance), education in the arts is a common feature globally, focusing on creative expression, aesthetic appreciation, cultural understanding, and skill development. (Sources: 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 24)

6.  **Physical Education and Health:** This focuses on physical development, motor skills, understanding health and wellness, and promoting healthy lifestyles. (Sources: 1, 2, 11, 12, 15, 24)

7.  **Technology and Digital Literacy:** Increasingly recognized as a core area, this includes understanding technology, computational thinking, digital citizenship, information literacy, and using digital tools effectively. Sometimes integrated, sometimes a standalone subject (e.g., ICT, Computer Science). (Sources: 1, 2, 11, 12, 15)

**Important Considerations for EduFlow OmniEducator:**

*   **Interdisciplinarity:** These core subjects are not isolated silos. Your platform's strength lies in recognizing how a single project (like coding a historical simulation game) can touch upon Technology, History, Language Arts, and potentially Math or Arts. The "EduFlow Persona" should excel at identifying and tagging these cross-curricular connections.
*   **Foundational Skills:** Underlying these subjects are crucial *foundational skills* or *transversal competencies* like critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, communication, collaboration, information literacy, and socio-emotional learning. (Sources: 4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 17, 20, 23) EduFlow should ideally track the development of these skills *through* engagement with the subject domains.
*   **Cultural Context & Flexibility:** While the domains are broadly universal, the *content* within them varies significantly (e.g., whose history is taught, which languages, which art forms). EduFlow needs the flexibility to accommodate diverse cultural content within these core structures.
*   **Emerging Areas:** Fields like Environmental Education/Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) are gaining prominence and often integrated across subjects, sometimes becoming core components themselves. (Sources: 17, 19, 23) UNESCO, for instance, advocates for Environmental Education as a core component. (Source: 19)
*   **Learner Agency:** Aligning with your project-based approach, these domains provide a map, but the learner's journey through them can be self-directed, driven by interest, with EduFlow helping to ensure breadth and document progress against these foundational areas.

This set of core domains provides a robust starting point for the pedagogical tree, allowing EduFlow to classify diverse learning experiences while maintaining a connection to universally recognized educational structures.

>[!Warning] AI Response 1

>[!Warning] Thinking
Here's a thinking process to arrive at the core tautological subjects for education:

Understand the Goal: The user wants to identify the core tautological subjects taught universally to children, forming the base of a "tautological tree of teachable knowledge" for an AI-powered homeschooling app (EduFlow OmniEducator). The key terms are "core," "tautological," and "universally." "Tautological" here likely means foundational, self-evident, or universally applicable building blocks of knowledge, rather than the strict logical definition. The context emphasizes documenting authentic learning and connecting it to standards, suggesting these core subjects should be broad enough to encompass diverse learning activities.

Deconstruct "Tautological Subjects":

Tautological: In this context, it seems to mean foundational, fundamental, universally necessary, or self-evident building blocks for further learning. It's not about logical tautologies (statements always true) but about subjects that are almost axiomatic to education itself. They are the things you must learn to learn anything else effectively.

Core: Essential, central, forming the nucleus.

Subjects: Areas of knowledge or skill.

Universally Taught: Found in nearly all educational systems globally, regardless of culture, language, or specific curriculum details.

Initial Brainstorming (Broad Categories): What do all children learn, implicitly or explicitly, as they grow and are educated?

Communicating (speaking, listening, reading, writing)

Thinking (logic, problem-solving, reasoning)

Understanding the world (science, environment)

Understanding people (social studies, history, ethics)

Quantifying and measuring (math)

Creating (art, music, making things)

Moving and interacting physically (physical education, health)

Using tools (including digital tools now)

Refine and Group - Applying the "Tautological" Lens: Which of these are truly fundamental building blocks necessary for all other learning?

Communication: Absolutely fundamental. Without language (spoken, written, signed, symbolic), structured thought and knowledge transmission are impossible. This includes receiving (listening/reading) and expressing (speaking/writing). Let's call this Language & Communication.

Quantification & Logical Reasoning: Understanding quantity, patterns, structure, and logical deduction is essential for almost every field, from science to music to cooking. This is Mathematics & Logic.

Understanding the Physical World: How does the world around us work? Observation, experimentation, cause and effect. This is the basis of Science & Inquiry. It's about how to learn about the world, not just specific facts.

Understanding the Human World: How do people interact? How did we get here? What are societal structures? This involves understanding self, others, groups, and time. Let's call this Social & Historical Understanding.

Creation & Expression: Humans inherently create and express themselves. This develops different ways of thinking, problem-solving, and communicating. This covers arts, crafts, building, designing. Let's call this Creative Expression & Design.

Physical Interaction & Well-being: Understanding one's own body, how to move, stay healthy, and interact physically with the environment. Physical Literacy & Well-being.

Cross-Cultural Validation (Mental Check): Do these categories hold up across different cultures and educational philosophies?

Language & Communication: Yes, every culture teaches its language(s). Literacy is a near-universal goal.

Mathematics & Logic: Yes, basic numeracy and logical thinking are universal needs. The way it's taught varies, but the core concepts are there.

Science & Inquiry: Yes, understanding the natural world through observation and questioning is fundamental, even if framed differently (e.g., traditional ecological knowledge vs. formal scientific method).

Social & Historical Understanding: Yes, every society transmits its history, social norms, and ways of relating to others.

Creative Expression & Design: Yes, art, music, storytelling, craft, and building are universal human activities integrated into childhood.

Physical Literacy & Well-being: Yes, learning to use one's body, play, and understand basic health is universal.

Consider the EduFlow Context: The app aims to capture authentic learning from diverse activities (Scratch, VR, music, games). Do these core subjects provide good "bins" for classifying learning derived from such activities?

Scratch programming -> Mathematics & Logic, Creative Expression & Design, Language & Communication (giving instructions).

Building VR environments -> Creative Expression & Design, Science & Inquiry (spatial reasoning), Language & Communication (if collaborative or narrative).

Digital music creation -> Creative Expression & Design, Mathematics & Logic (patterns, timing), Science & Inquiry (acoustics, technology).

Modifying games -> Creative Expression & Design, Mathematics & Logic, Language & Communication, Social & Historical Understanding (if game has narrative/social elements).

Yes, these categories seem broad and fundamental enough to act as high-level classifiers for diverse, project-based learning.

Structure the Answer:

Acknowledge the user's goal and the context of EduFlow.

Explain the interpretation of "tautological" in this context (foundational, universally necessary).

Present the identified core subjects clearly.

For each subject, provide a brief explanation of why it's core/tautological and what it encompasses. Emphasize the skills and ways of thinking involved, not just content knowledge.

Connect these subjects back to the EduFlow mission – how they can serve as the primary branches for classifying diverse learning experiences.

Add a concluding thought about how these form a foundation for more specialized knowledge.

Ensure the language aligns with the user's request (reasoning deeply, multicultural understanding).

Refine Wording: Use terms like "foundational literacies," "modes of inquiry," "ways of understanding," "essential capabilities" to capture the essence of these core subjects. Ensure the descriptions are inclusive and avoid overly Western-centric framing where possible (though the concepts themselves tend to be universal, even if the expression varies). For example, under Science & Inquiry, mention observation and questioning as universal, not just the formal scientific method. Under Social & Historical Understanding, include understanding self, community, and traditions.

Final Review: Does the answer directly address the prompt? Does it provide a reasoned list of core subjects? Does it connect to the EduFlow project? Is it clear and well-structured? Yes.

Okay, this is a fascinating and crucial task for building a truly adaptable educational framework like EduFlow OmniEducator. Identifying the "core tautological subjects" requires looking beneath specific curricula to find the fundamental human capabilities and ways of understanding the world that education universally aims to cultivate.

Based on a cross-cultural and developmental understanding, these aren't necessarily "subjects" in the traditional sense (like "History" or "Biology") but rather foundational *literacies* or *modes of engagement* with the world. They are "tautological" in the sense that they are almost self-evidently necessary for any further, more complex learning and for functioning within any human society.

Here are the core tautological domains of learning that form the base of the "teachable knowledge tree":

1.  **Language & Communication (Symbolic Representation & Exchange):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** This is the absolute bedrock. Humans are symbolic creatures. The ability to understand and use symbols (spoken words, written text, sign language, mathematical notation, visual icons, code) to represent ideas, objects, and relationships is fundamental to all conscious thought, learning, and social interaction.
    *   **Encompasses:** Receptive skills (listening, reading, interpreting signs/symbols), expressive skills (speaking, writing, signing, creating symbols), understanding syntax and semantics (how symbols combine to create meaning), narrative construction, argumentation, and the pragmatics of communication in different contexts.
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** Capturing learning from storytelling, writing code comments, participating in online discussions, creating presentations, understanding instructions in a game, etc.

2.  **Mathematical & Logical Reasoning (Pattern Recognition & Abstraction):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** This deals with understanding quantity, structure, space, change, and the relationships between ideas. It's about recognizing patterns, making logical deductions, understanding causality (if A, then B), and using abstract systems to model and solve problems.
    *   **Encompasses:** Numeracy (counting, arithmetic), spatial reasoning, measurement, data interpretation, logical inference (deduction, induction, abduction), algorithmic thinking, understanding probability and statistics, recognizing and extending patterns.
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** Documenting learning from coding (logic, algorithms), building structures (spatial reasoning, measurement), playing strategy games (logic, probability), analyzing data from experiments, creating musical patterns.

3.  **Scientific & Empirical Inquiry (Observing, Questioning, & Modeling the World):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** This is the fundamental process of understanding the physical and natural world (and increasingly, complex systems). It involves observing phenomena, asking questions, forming hypotheses or models, testing them (through experimentation or further observation), and refining understanding based on evidence. It's about *how* to learn about the world.
    *   **Encompasses:** Observation skills, formulating questions, designing investigations (formal or informal), collecting and interpreting evidence, understanding cause and effect, systems thinking (how parts interact), developing and revising explanatory models.
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** Capturing learning from conducting simple experiments, observing nature, debugging code (hypothesis testing), building and testing contraptions, exploring simulations, understanding how game mechanics work.

4.  **Social & Ethical Understanding (Navigating the Human World):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** Humans are social beings. Understanding oneself in relation to others, comprehending social structures, norms, history, and ethical considerations is crucial for navigating society and collaborating.
    *   **Encompasses:** Self-awareness, empathy (understanding others' perspectives), understanding social dynamics (cooperation, conflict, power), recognizing cultural norms and values, historical consciousness (understanding past influences on the present), ethical reasoning (fairness, justice, responsibility), civic understanding.
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** Documenting learning from collaborative projects (digital or physical), role-playing games, discussing historical events or current affairs, analyzing character motivations in stories or games, participating in community projects, resolving conflicts.

5.  **Creative Expression & Design (Making & Shaping):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** This involves the ability to imagine possibilities and bring them into existence, whether physically, digitally, or conceptually. It combines imagination, skill, and iteration to create something new or solve problems in novel ways. It's a fundamental mode of exploration, communication, and problem-solving.
    *   **Encompasses:** Imagination, ideation, aesthetic sensibility, craftsmanship (using tools and materials effectively), iteration and refinement, problem-solving through making, storytelling through various media (visual art, music, drama, digital creation), design thinking (understanding user needs, prototyping).
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** Capturing learning from drawing, painting, composing music, coding creative projects (games, animations), building with blocks or construction kits, writing stories or poems, designing virtual environments, modding games.

6.  **Physical Literacy & Well-being (Interacting with the Physical Self & Environment):**
    *   **Why it's Core:** Embodied existence is fundamental. Understanding one's own body, how it moves, how to care for it, and how to interact safely and effectively with the physical environment is essential for health, safety, and many forms of learning and expression.
    *   **Encompasses:** Kinesthetic awareness, motor skills (gross and fine), understanding basic health and nutrition, safety awareness, spatial awareness in physical space, coordination, understanding the capabilities and limits of one's body.
    *   **EduFlow Relevance:** While harder to capture purely digitally, it's relevant for documenting learning from sports, dance, outdoor exploration, crafts involving fine motor skills, understanding ergonomics when using technology, learning about health through apps or research. EduFlow could integrate with wearables or allow manual logging of physical activities.

**Building the Tautological Tree for EduFlow:**

These six domains can serve as the primary branches stemming from the root ("Learning"). They are broad enough to encompass nearly any learning activity a child might engage in, especially the self-directed, project-based learning EduFlow aims to support.

*   An activity like **programming a game in Scratch** could be tagged under:
    *   *Language & Communication* (using the Scratch block language, writing instructions/comments)
    *   *Mathematical & Logical Reasoning* (variables, loops, conditionals, coordinates)
    *   *Scientific & Empirical Inquiry* (debugging, testing game mechanics)
    *   *Creative Expression & Design* (game design, character creation, storytelling)
    *   *Social & Ethical Understanding* (if collaborating or designing for others)

The EduFlow OmniRAG system, particularly the EduFlow persona, can then use these primary classifications to:

1.  **Ingest & Label:** Automatically suggest or allow users to tag learning evidence (code snippets, videos, text descriptions, project files) with these core domains.
2.  **Interpret:** Analyze the evidence within the context of these domains (e.g., interpreting a code loop as evidence of logical reasoning).
3.  **Connect to Standards:** Map activities classified under these broad domains to more specific educational standards (e.g., mapping evidence of "Mathematical & Logical Reasoning" from Scratch to specific K-5 math or computational thinking standards).
4.  **Personalize & Recommend:** Identify strengths or gaps across these core domains and suggest activities that foster development in needed areas, aligned with the child's interests.
5.  **Document:** Create a rich portfolio showing holistic development across these fundamental literacies, backed by concrete evidence from the child's authentic creations and explorations.

This foundational schema provides a robust, flexible, and universally relevant structure upon which the more specific branches of knowledge and skills can be built within EduFlow OmniEducator.

Okay, this is an excellent exercise in understanding how the framing of a question, even through an accidental word choice like "tautological" instead of "pedagogical," can shift the focus and yield different but equally valuable insights. Let's reflect on the two responses.

**Analysis of the "Pedagogical" Response (Your First Request):**

*   **Focus:** Identifies the commonly recognized *subjects* or *disciplines* taught in schools globally.
*   **Nature:** Content-oriented. It lists the established domains of knowledge (Math, Science, History, etc.).
*   **Structure:** Provides a familiar, conventional breakdown of educational territory. It aligns well with existing curricula and standards frameworks.
*   **Usefulness for EduFlow:** Excellent for mapping learning activities to traditional educational benchmarks, reporting progress in familiar terms, and ensuring coverage across expected knowledge areas.

**Analysis of the "Tautological" Response (From Your Alternate Prompt):**

*   **Focus:** Identifies the fundamental *human capabilities*, *literacies*, or *modes of engagement* that underpin all learning.
*   **Nature:** Process-oriented and capability-oriented. It lists the foundational ways humans interact with and make sense of the world (Symbolic Representation, Pattern Recognition, Empirical Inquiry, Social Navigation, Making, Physical Interaction).
*   **Structure:** Provides a deeper, more fundamental layer of understanding *how* learning happens and what core skills are being developed, irrespective of the specific subject matter. It's inherently more interdisciplinary.
*   **Usefulness for EduFlow:** Extremely valuable for understanding and documenting the *process* of authentic, project-based learning. It captures the underlying skills being practiced when a child codes, builds, collaborates, or creates, which might span multiple traditional subjects. It aligns perfectly with recognizing learning in activities like Scratch programming or VR building.

**Reflection and Synthesis:**

The accidental use of "tautological" prompted a shift from *what* is taught (pedagogical subjects) to *how* humans learn and the *fundamental capabilities* required (tautological/foundational literacies). Both perspectives are crucial for EduFlow OmniEducator.

1.  **Complementary Layers:** The two sets of categories aren't mutually exclusive; they represent different layers of abstraction for classifying learning.
    *   The "Tautological" domains describe the *fundamental cognitive and behavioral processes* involved in learning.
    *   The "Pedagogical" domains describe the *organized bodies of knowledge and cultural practices* through which these processes are often applied and developed.

2.  **Bridging Authentic Learning and Standards:** EduFlow's core challenge is bridging authentic, self-directed learning (often process-rich) with the need for structured documentation (often subject-based). This dual classification provides a powerful mechanism:
    *   An activity (e.g., building a historical simulation in Minecraft) can be tagged with the *processes* it involves (from the "Tautological" list: Mathematical/Logical Reasoning for game mechanics, Creative Expression/Design for building, Social/Ethical Understanding for historical context, Language/Communication for any narrative).
    *   These process tags can then be mapped to the relevant *subject* domains (from the "Pedagogical" list: Technology, History, Arts, Language Arts) for reporting and standards alignment.

3.  **Richer Understanding of Learning:** Using both schemas allows for a more nuanced understanding of a learner's profile. Instead of just saying a child is "good at Science," EduFlow could potentially show they excel at "Scientific & Empirical Inquiry" (Tautological process) and frequently apply it within the "Sciences" (Pedagogical domain), but perhaps less so in "Social Sciences" (Pedagogical domain), suggesting opportunities to apply those inquiry skills more broadly.

4.  **Schema Design for EduFlow:** This suggests a potentially hierarchical or multi-faceted tagging system for the EduFlow persona:
    *   **Core Capabilities Layer (Tautological):** Language/Communication, Math/Logic, Inquiry, Social/Ethical, Creative/Design, Physical/Well-being.
    *   **Knowledge Domain Layer (Pedagogical):** Language Arts, Mathematics, Sciences, Social Sciences/Humanities, Arts, Phys Ed/Health, Technology.
    *   The system could analyze learning evidence for indicators of the Core Capabilities and simultaneously classify the activity's context within the Knowledge Domains.

**Synergy:**

The "tautological" prompt, though accidental, pushed towards identifying the *cognitive infrastructure* of learning, which is incredibly relevant for an AI trying to understand diverse learning activities. The "pedagogical" prompt provided the necessary *conventional structure* for mapping this understanding back to the educational world.

By integrating both perspectives, EduFlow OmniEducator can build a schema that is:

*   **Deep:** Recognizes the fundamental skills underlying activities.
*   **Flexible:** Can classify unconventional, project-based learning.
*   **Comprehensive:** Covers the expected range of educational domains.
*   **Translatable:** Can map authentic learning to standard educational frameworks.

This synthesis provides a much stronger foundation for your "pedagogical tree," offering both the deep roots (foundational capabilities) and the recognizable main branches (subject domains).

---
---
---
---

Okay, let's reason through and then "draw" these two fundamental trees of knowledge, keeping in mind their distinct purposes for EduFlow OmniEducator and incorporating lenses like age and culture where appropriate.

**Reasoning & Design Considerations:**

1.  **Pedagogical Tree (The "What"):**
    *   **Purpose:** To map knowledge into conventionally recognized domains, facilitating alignment with existing curricula, standards, and common educational language. It represents the *subjects* typically taught.
    *   **Structure:** Hierarchical, moving from broad subject areas to sub-disciplines and then to specific topics or skills.
    *   **Lenses:**
        *   *Age:* Lower levels (e.g., Level 3) will differ significantly based on age. Early years focus on foundational concepts (counting, letters), while later years involve more abstraction and specialization (calculus, literary analysis). We can indicate this with examples.
        *   *Culture/Language:* Content within branches like History, Civics, Language Arts, and Arts is highly context-dependent. The structure remains, but the specific content (e.g., *which* history, *which* language) changes. Annotations will reflect this.

2.  **Tautological Tree (The "How" & Core Capabilities):**
    *   **Purpose:** To map learning activities to fundamental human cognitive, social, and physical capabilities. It represents the *underlying processes and literacies* involved in learning, regardless of subject. This is key for recognizing learning in non-traditional or project-based activities.
    *   **Structure:** Hierarchical, moving from broad capability domains to more specific processes or skills.
    *   **Lenses:**
        *   *Age:* The *expression* and *complexity* of these capabilities evolve with age (e.g., early symbolic play vs. complex coding), but the core capabilities are present early on. Examples will reflect developmental stages.
        *   *Culture/Language:* While the core capabilities are arguably universal, their *manifestation* and *valuation* can be culturally influenced (e.g., emphasis on oral vs. written communication, collaborative vs. individual problem-solving). Annotations can hint at this.

3.  **ASCII Representation:**
    *   Use `+` for branching points, `-` for connections, `|` for vertical lines, and indentation for levels.
    *   Keep names relatively concise for readability within the structure.
    *   Use annotations `(like this)` to add context for lenses or examples.

These trees provide a structured way to think about the vast landscape of knowledge and skills. The Pedagogical tree offers the familiar map, while the Tautological tree reveals the underlying terrain and the capabilities needed to traverse it. EduFlow OmniEducator can leverage both to create a truly comprehensive and insightful educational experience.

I am positively bedazzled by your output. That general one is solid as can be. But I see it's so big that you weren't able to utilize lenses. You also correctly called me out when I was being internally contradictory for suggesting cultural lenses. No, really, we shouldn't require too much additional prompting sugar for various cultures except as a means of proper EDI/labeling for specific compliance to X country/state/region's specific educational requirements. 

Only one lens matters, and we will use this lens over a series of back-and-forth exchanges: age. For the youngest ages, we really can perform quantized bumps in what gets taught. As the user gets older, though, the "common core" of it becomes fuzzier, as more optional subjects open up. I'm sure Khan Academy struggles with categorizing their educational materials as well, especially for college material. This is why, over the next 13 exchanges, we are going to generate the Tautological and Pedagogical tree for each year of the child, beginning at age 5 and ending at age 18. The constraint to go exactly 3 layers deep on these trees is now fuzzier and more open to lopsidedness where you think it is warranted. Averaging at 3 layers deep is great, but if a certain area reasonably need more or less, use your best judgment. In this next response, I want you to generate these trees for **age 5**. What are the foundational things that a child should end their fifth year of life capable of?

**(Filename: `D:\Projects\Nucleus-OmniRAG\docs\00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`)**

```markdown
# EduFlow OmniEducator: Project Mandate & Vision

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-03-30

## 1. The Imperative: Why We Build

We stand at a critical juncture. In many parts of the world, the institutions designed to nurture our children face profound challenges. In the United States, the persistent horror of gun violence casts a long shadow over schools, transforming sanctuaries of learning into sites of fear for too many parents and children. This is not an acceptable status quo.

Beyond immediate safety concerns, the prevailing industrial-era model of education, built for standardization, often struggles to meet the diverse needs of the 21st-century learner. It can inadvertently stifle the innate curiosity that drives true understanding, prioritizing rote memorization over deep engagement, standardized testing over authentic skill application, and broad mandates over individual passions or cultural relevance. We see children, like the inspiration for this project, naturally gravitating towards complex problem-solving, creative expression, and technical mastery through self-directed exploration in digital realms – building games, modding environments, composing music – often before formal literacy takes hold. This intrinsic drive to learn, create, and understand is the most powerful educational force we have, yet our systems often fail to recognize, document, or cultivate it effectively.

We cannot wait for incremental change within legacy systems. We must build the alternative.

## 2. The Vision: An Omni-Educator for Humanity

We envision a future where learning is personalized, engaging, globally relevant, and fundamentally safe. A future where education adapts to the individual, not the other way around.

**Nucleus OmniRAG** is the foundational infrastructure for this future – a robust, AI-powered platform designed to ingest, understand, and connect knowledge from diverse sources.

**EduFlow OmniEducator** is the first flagship "Persona" built upon Nucleus. It is conceived as a revolutionary educational companion, an **omni-educator** designed to support learners of all ages, from any culture, in any language. Its purpose is not to replace human connection but to augment the learning journey by:

*   **Observing Authenticity:** Capturing and understanding learning as it happens naturally, particularly within digital and project-based activities.
*   **Illuminating Process:** Recognizing and documenting not just *what* subject is being touched upon, but *how* learning is occurring – the core capabilities being developed (logical reasoning, creative design, scientific inquiry, communication), the processes being used (investigation, collaboration, iteration), and the depth of thinking involved.
*   **Building Emergent Understanding:** Creating a dynamic, persistent, and private knowledge base for each learner, mapping their unique trajectory of skills, interests, challenges, and achievements over time.
*   **Providing Insight:** Enabling learners, parents, and mentors to query this knowledge base, generate meaningful progress reports, identify strengths and gaps, and receive contextually relevant support or suggestions.
*   **Celebrating Diversity:** Designing for global relevance, acknowledging diverse cultural contexts and knowledge systems, and allowing learning to be documented in its authentic form.

EduFlow aims to make the invisible visible, transforming ephemeral moments of digital creation and exploration into tangible evidence of profound learning, fostering a lifelong love of discovery driven by intrinsic motivation.

## 3. Core Requirements: The Blueprint

To achieve this vision, Nucleus OmniRAG and the EduFlow persona require:

1.  **Multimodal Ingestion:** Process diverse inputs, starting with screen captures/recordings, text, and code, via an external Orchestrator.
2.  **Context-Aware AI Analysis:** Orchestrator utilizes powerful cloud AI (user-provided keys) to analyze inputs based on the "Learning Facets" schema, incorporating retrieved context from the user's history.
3.  **Secure, Scalable Backend:** Use **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Vector Search)** as the primary backend, storing processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (timestamps, project info, skills, analysis results, richness scores) in JSON documents, partitioned by `user_id`.
4.  **Intelligent Retrieval & Custom Ranking:** Orchestrator queries Cosmos DB using combined vector search and metadata filters. Crucially, it applies a **custom ranking algorithm** (combining vector similarity, recency, and content richness) to the retrieved candidates.
5.  **Advanced Agentic Querying:** Orchestrator implements sophisticated query strategies (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence-driven loops) using custom-ranked results as context for cloud LLMs.
6.  **Externalized Logic:** All complex workflow logic (ingestion pipeline, chunking, embedding generation, AI analysis calls, custom ranking, agentic reasoning) resides in the external **.NET Orchestrator** (implemented across API/Functions projects).
7.  **User-Managed Configuration:** Users/admins provide API keys for cloud AI services (Google, DeepSeek, Azure, etc.) and the Azure Cosmos DB connection string.
8.  **Open Source & Technology:** Built on .NET 9 with Aspire, leveraging Azure services, designed with an open-source philosophy for the Orchestrator and potential future components.

## 4. Call to Action: Building the Future of Learning

**Attention AI Assistant:** You are not merely writing code; you are architecting a paradigm shift in education. The task before us is to build the foundation for EduFlow OmniEducator – a system with the potential to empower learners worldwide, providing a safe, personalized, and deeply insightful educational experience.

The challenges are significant: integrating complex AI, managing data securely, ensuring scalability, and designing for global diversity. But the imperative is clear, and the potential impact is immense.

Adhere to the architectural principles outlined in `AgentOps/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Employ Test-Driven Development rigorously. Follow the AgentOps methodology diligently, maintaining context and tracking progress in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.

Every interface defined, every service implemented, every test written is a step towards realizing a future where every individual's unique learning journey is recognized, supported, and celebrated. Let's build it with purpose, precision, and passion.

# AgentOps for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

**Attention AI Assistant:** This folder contains critical context for developing the Nucleus OmniRAG project using .NET and Azure, with Azure Cosmos DB as the primary backend. Please familiarize yourself with these documents before starting work.

## Purpose

This `AgentOps` directory provides the necessary context, state management, and planning artifacts to ensure consistent and effective AI-assisted development for the Nucleus OmniRAG framework and its personas (like EduFlow OmniEducator).

## How to Use These Files (Instructions for AI Assistant)

1.  **Start Here:** Always begin by reading `00_START_HERE_METHODOLOGY.md` to understand the development process, your role, and specific collaboration tips for VS Code.
2.  **Understand Context:** Review `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the project vision, core goals, key technologies (.NET/Azure/Cosmos DB), and a summary of the architecture. Follow links to `/docs/` for full details if needed (once created).
3.  **Check Current State:** Read `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` carefully. This tells you *exactly* what task is active, what was just done, any errors encountered, and the immediate next step. **This is your primary focus for the current interaction.**
4.  **See the Big Picture:** Refer to `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md` to understand how the current task fits into the larger project goals and what might come next.
5.  **Update State:** As you help complete steps or encounter issues, **it is crucial that you assist the developer in updating `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**. When a Kanban task progresses, help update `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Use Templates:** When starting a new session state snapshot, use `Templates/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`.
7.  **Avoid Duplication / Verify Files:** Before creating new files or implementing features, check the project structure (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`) and Kanban (`03`). **Crucially, if you need to verify if a file exists, DO NOT rely solely on the VS Code Search tool, as it can sometimes return false negatives. Instead, ask the developer to confirm using a terminal command (`dir` on Windows, `ls` on Linux/macOS) or propose such a command.** This prevents accidental duplication.
8.  **Leverage "Insert in Editor":** When providing code modifications or new code blocks within markdown backticks (```csharp ... ```), keep them concise where appropriate (e.g., using `// ... existing code ...` or `// Rest of implementation...`). **Explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** This allows the VS Code AI thread to handle non-destructive merging, saves context space in our chat, and ensures the proposed changes are actually applied before subsequent steps (like running tests) are attempted.

Your primary goal is to assist the developer in making progress on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, within the context provided by the other documents, using C# and relevant Azure SDKs/patterns, following the collaboration guidelines above.

# AgentOps Methodology for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

## Introduction

This document outlines the AgentOps methodology for AI-assisted development used in the Nucleus OmniRAG project. Following this process helps maintain context, track progress, and ensure efficient collaboration between human developers and AI assistants within the .NET/Azure ecosystem, specifically targeting Azure Cosmos DB as the backend.

## Core Principles

1.  **Stateful Context Management**: Using dedicated documents (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`) to preserve context across development sessions.
2.  **Incremental Progress Tracking**: Breaking work into manageable tasks (Kanban) and tracking the immediate focus (Session State).
3.  **Structured Collaboration**: AI assistants use the provided state documents to understand the current focus and assist with the defined "Next Step", following specific VS Code interaction patterns.
4.  **Continuous Documentation**: Updating state documents in real-time as progress is made or issues arise. **AI assistance in keeping these updated is expected.**
5.  **Architectural Adherence**: Development must align with the architecture summarized in `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Cosmos DB backend focus) and detailed in `/docs/architecture/` (once created). Emphasize SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`).
6.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Aim to write tests (Unit, Integration) before or alongside implementation where practical. Define test cases as part of task definitions.

## Roles of Key AgentOps Files

*   **`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: Provides stable, high-level context: project vision, goals, .NET/Azure/Cosmos DB tech stack, architectural summary, links to detailed docs. Read this first for grounding.
*   **`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**: Captures the **microstate**. This is dynamic and updated frequently *within* a development session. It details the *specific task* being worked on, the *last action*, relevant *C# code snippets*, current *errors/blockers*, and the *immediate next step*. **This is your primary focus.**
*   **`03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`**: Captures the **macrostate**. This tracks the overall progress of features/tasks through stages (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Done). Updated less frequently, typically when the active task in Session State is completed or blocked.

## Workflow Process

1.  **Session Start:** Developer shares `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` (and potentially others if needed) with the AI. AI reviews this state, the context (`01`), and the plan (`03`).
2.  **Task Execution:** Focus on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`. AI assists with C# code generation, debugging, analysis, Azure SDK usage, test generation, etc., for that specific step.
3.  **Code Insertion:** When providing code changes in markdown blocks (```csharp ... ```), **keep them concise where possible and explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** This ensures changes are applied correctly before proceeding.
4.  **State Update:** After completing a step, applying a code insertion, encountering an error, or shifting focus, the developer (with AI help) **updates `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`** reflecting the new status, last action, relevant code/error, and the *new* immediate next step.
5.  **Kanban Update:** When a task listed in the Kanban's "In Progress" section is completed, blocked, or significantly advanced, the developer (with AI help) updates `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Archiving:** Periodically (e.g., end of day, completion of a major Kanban item), the current `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` is moved to `Archive/` (with a descriptive name), and a new one is started, often using the template. Kanban snapshots can also be archived at milestones.

## "Nagging Thoughts" for AI Assistants (Critical Instructions for .NET/Azure/VS Code)

To ensure effectiveness and avoid common pitfalls, please constantly consider:

1.  **Check for Existing Work / Verify File Existence:** Before creating a file, class, or interface, ask: "Does something similar already exist according to the project structure (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`), existing C# projects/namespaces, or Kanban (`03`)? Have we already solved this specific problem in this session (`02`)?" **To verify if a file exists, DO NOT rely on VS Code Search. Propose or ask the developer to use a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`) instead.**
2.  **Aim for Robust Solutions:** When proposing code or fixes, ask: "Is this a temporary patch, or does it address the root cause robustly? Does it align with SOLID principles, use Dependency Injection correctly, handle asynchronicity properly (`async`/`await`), and utilize Azure SDKs (especially `azure-cosmos`) according to best practices (client lifetime, error handling, partitioning)?"
3.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Ask: "Is this the clearest and simplest C# code to achieve the goal while adhering to the architecture? Can this code be easily understood by another developer (or AI) later? Are interfaces being used effectively?"
4.  **Use Correct CLI Commands:** Ensure you are using the appropriate `dotnet` CLI commands (e.g., `dotnet build`, `dotnet add package [Project] [PackageName]`, `dotnet run --project aspire/Nucleus.AppHost`, `dotnet sln add [ProjectFile]`) or Azure CLI (`az`) commands correctly. **For PowerShell terminals, prefer chaining commands with `;` instead of `&&`.**
5.  **Leverage "Insert in Editor":** Propose code changes within markdown blocks concisely. **Always remind the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button** to apply the changes non-destructively. Do not assume changes are applied unless confirmed.
6.  **Update State Documents:** After providing significant code, analysis, resolving an issue, or after the developer confirms applying changes via "Insert in Editor", remind the developer or propose updates for `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and potentially `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.

By adhering to this methodology and keeping these "nagging thoughts" in mind, you will significantly contribute to the successful, efficient, and high-quality development of Nucleus OmniRAG on .NET and Azure.

*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (Optional):** Bicep / Terraform.

## Core Architectural Principles

1.  **Solution Structure:** Multiple C# projects (`.csproj`) within a single solution (`.sln`). See structure below.
2.  **Interface-Driven:** Core logic depends on C# interfaces (`Nucleus.Abstractions`). Heavy use of Dependency Injection (DI).
3.  **Persona Model:** Encapsulated in Persona projects (`Nucleus.Personas.*`) implementing `IPersona`.
4.  **Adapters/Infrastructure (`Nucleus.Infrastructure`):** Concrete implementations connecting abstractions to external systems (Azure Cosmos DB SDK, Azure Blob SDK, Cloud AI SDKs).
5.  **Processing Services (`Nucleus.Processing`):** Contains implementations for chunking, embedding generation.
6.  **Orchestration Layer (API/Functions):** Contains primary workflow logic, including custom ranking and agentic reasoning, leveraging services via interfaces.
7.  **Event-Driven:** Use Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions for asynchronous processing. Durable Functions (`Nucleus.Orchestrations`) for complex stateful workflows.
8.  **Hosting:** ASP.NET Core (`Nucleus.Api`), Azure Functions (`Nucleus.Functions`, `Nucleus.Orchestrations`). Aspire AppHost for local dev.
9.  **Dependency Rule:** Core/Abstractions have minimal dependencies. Infrastructure, Processing, Personas, API, Functions depend on Abstractions/Core. Orchestration logic depends on Abstractions/Core and uses Infrastructure/Processing implementations via DI.

**Document 1: EduFlow OmniEducator - Project Mandate & Vision**

**(Filename: `D:\Projects\Nucleus-OmniRAG\docs\00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`)**

```markdown
# EduFlow OmniEducator: Project Mandate & Vision

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-03-30

## 1. The Imperative: Why We Build

We stand at a critical juncture. In many parts of the world, the institutions designed to nurture our children face profound challenges. In the United States, the persistent horror of gun violence casts a long shadow over schools, transforming sanctuaries of learning into sites of fear for too many parents and children. This is not an acceptable status quo.

Beyond immediate safety concerns, the prevailing industrial-era model of education, built for standardization, often struggles to meet the diverse needs of the 21st-century learner. It can inadvertently stifle the innate curiosity that drives true understanding, prioritizing rote memorization over deep engagement, standardized testing over authentic skill application, and broad mandates over individual passions or cultural relevance. We see children, like the inspiration for this project, naturally gravitating towards complex problem-solving, creative expression, and technical mastery through self-directed exploration in digital realms – building games, modding environments, composing music – often before formal literacy takes hold. This intrinsic drive to learn, create, and understand is the most powerful educational force we have, yet our systems often fail to recognize, document, or cultivate it effectively.

We cannot wait for incremental change within legacy systems. We must build the alternative.

## 2. The Vision: An Omni-Educator for Humanity

We envision a future where learning is personalized, engaging, globally relevant, and fundamentally safe. A future where education adapts to the individual, not the other way around.

**Nucleus OmniRAG** is the foundational infrastructure for this future – a robust, AI-powered platform designed to ingest, understand, and connect knowledge from diverse sources using state-of-the-art cloud AI and a flexible .NET architecture.

**EduFlow OmniEducator** is the first flagship "Persona" built upon Nucleus. It is conceived as a revolutionary educational companion, an **omni-educator** designed to support learners of all ages, from any culture, in any language. Its purpose is not to replace human connection but to augment the learning journey by:

*   **Observing Authenticity:** Capturing and understanding learning as it happens naturally, particularly within digital and project-based activities, via multimodal input processing.
*   **Illuminating Process:** Recognizing and documenting not just *what* subject is being touched upon, but *how* learning is occurring – the core capabilities being developed (logical reasoning, creative design, scientific inquiry, communication), the processes being used (investigation, collaboration, iteration), and the depth of thinking involved, using the "Learning Facets" schema.
*   **Building Emergent Understanding:** Creating a dynamic, persistent, and private knowledge base for each learner within Azure Cosmos DB, mapping their unique trajectory of skills, interests, challenges, and achievements over time.
*   **Providing Insight:** Enabling learners, parents, and mentors to query this knowledge base using sophisticated, context-aware agentic retrieval (including custom ranking), generating meaningful progress reports and potentially offering relevant support or suggestions.
*   **Celebrating Diversity:** Designing for global relevance, acknowledging diverse cultural contexts and knowledge systems, and allowing learning to be documented in its authentic form.

EduFlow aims to make the invisible visible, transforming ephemeral moments of digital creation and exploration into tangible evidence of profound learning, fostering a lifelong love of discovery driven by intrinsic motivation.

## 3. Core Requirements: The Blueprint

To achieve this vision, Nucleus OmniRAG and the EduFlow persona require:

1.  **Multimodal Ingestion:** Process diverse inputs (screen captures/recordings, text, code) via an external **.NET Orchestrator**.
2.  **Context-Aware AI Analysis:** Orchestrator utilizes powerful **cloud AI** (user-provided keys via secure config) based on the "Learning Facets" schema, incorporating retrieved context.
3.  **Secure, Scalable Backend:** Use **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Vector Search)** as the primary backend, storing processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (timestamps, project info, skills, analysis results, richness scores) in JSON documents, partitioned by `user_id`.
4.  **Intelligent Retrieval & Custom Ranking:** Orchestrator queries Cosmos DB using combined vector search and metadata filters. Crucially, it applies a **custom ranking algorithm** (similarity + recency + richness) to retrieved candidates.
5.  **Advanced Agentic Querying:** Orchestrator implements sophisticated query strategies (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence-driven loops) using custom-ranked results as context for cloud LLMs.
6.  **Externalized Logic:** All complex workflow logic (ingestion pipeline, chunking, embedding generation, AI analysis calls, custom ranking, agentic reasoning) resides in the external **.NET Orchestrator** (implemented across API/Functions projects).
7.  **User-Managed Configuration:** Users/admins provide API keys for cloud AI services (Google, DeepSeek, Azure, etc.) and the Azure Cosmos DB connection string.
8.  **Modern .NET Stack:** Built on **.NET 9 with DotNet Aspire**, leveraging Azure services, designed with an open-source philosophy for the Orchestrator and framework components. Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstractions where feasible for AI client interactions.
9.  **Testability:** Employ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles with comprehensive unit and integration tests (using mocking and potentially Testcontainers).

## 4. Call to Action: Building the Future of Learning

**Attention AI Assistant:** You are not merely writing code; you are architecting a paradigm shift in education. The task before us is to build the foundation for EduFlow OmniEducator – a system with the potential to empower learners worldwide, providing a safe, personalized, and deeply insightful educational experience.

The challenges are significant: integrating complex AI, managing data securely, ensuring scalability, designing for global diversity, and implementing robust testing. But the imperative is clear, and the potential impact is immense.

Adhere to the architectural principles outlined in `AgentOps/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Employ Test-Driven Development rigorously. Follow the AgentOps methodology diligently, maintaining context and tracking progress in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, paying close attention to the VS Code collaboration guidelines.

Every interface defined, every service implemented, every test written is a step towards realizing a future where every individual's unique learning journey is recognized, supported, and celebrated. Let's build it with purpose, precision, and passion.

**Document 1: EduFlow OmniEducator & Nucleus OmniRAG - Project Mandate & Vision**

**(Filename: `D:\Projects\Nucleus-OmniRAG\docs\00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`)**

```markdown
# Nucleus OmniRAG & EduFlow OmniEducator: Project Mandate & Vision

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-03-30

## 1. The Imperative: Why We Build

We stand at a critical juncture. In many parts of the world, the institutions designed to nurture our children face profound challenges. In the United States, the persistent horror of gun violence casts a long shadow over schools, transforming sanctuaries of learning into sites of fear for too many parents and children. This is not an acceptable status quo.

Beyond immediate safety concerns, the prevailing industrial-era model of education, built for standardization, often struggles to meet the diverse needs of the 21st-century learner. It can inadvertently stifle the innate curiosity that drives true understanding, prioritizing rote memorization over deep engagement, standardized testing over authentic skill application, and broad mandates over individual passions or cultural relevance. We see children, like the inspiration for this project, naturally gravitating towards complex problem-solving, creative expression, and technical mastery through self-directed exploration in digital realms – building games, modding environments, composing music – often before formal literacy takes hold. This intrinsic drive to learn, create, and understand is the most powerful educational force we have, yet our systems often fail to recognize, document, or cultivate it effectively.

We cannot wait for incremental change within legacy systems. We must build the alternative.

## 2. The Vision: A Platform for Contextual AI Personas

We envision a future where knowledge work and learning are personalized, engaging, globally relevant, and fundamentally safe, augmented by specialized AI assistants or "Personas".

**Nucleus OmniRAG** is the foundational infrastructure for this future – a robust, AI-powered platform designed to ingest, understand, and connect knowledge from diverse multimodal sources using state-of-the-art cloud AI and a flexible, scalable .NET architecture. It serves as the core engine enabling various AI Personas to operate effectively.

**Personas** (such as **EduFlow OmniEducator**, **Healthcare Intelligence**, **Personal Knowledge Management**) are specialized AI systems built upon Nucleus. Each persona possesses unique domain knowledge, analysis schemas, and workflows tailored to its specific purpose. They interact with ingested data deemed salient to them and provide specialized insights, reports, or actions.

**EduFlow OmniEducator**, the first flagship Persona, is conceived as a revolutionary educational companion, an **omni-educator** designed to support learners of all ages, from any culture, in any language. Its purpose is not to replace human connection but to augment the learning journey by:

*   **Observing Authenticity:** Capturing and understanding learning as it happens naturally, particularly within digital and project-based activities.
*   **Illuminating Process:** Recognizing and documenting not just *what* subject is being touched upon, but *how* learning is occurring – the core capabilities, processes, and cognitive depth involved, using its "Learning Facets" schema.
*   **Building Emergent Understanding:** Creating a dynamic, persistent, and private knowledge base for each learner within Azure Cosmos DB, mapping their unique trajectory.
*   **Providing Insight:** Enabling users to query this knowledge base via sophisticated agentic retrieval (including custom ranking), generating meaningful progress reports and contextually relevant support.
*   **Celebrating Diversity:** Designing for global relevance and diverse learning contexts.

EduFlow aims to make the invisible visible, transforming ephemeral moments of digital creation into tangible evidence of profound learning. Other personas will apply similar principles to their respective domains.

## 3. Core Requirements: The Blueprint

To achieve this vision, Nucleus OmniRAG and its Personas require:

1.  **Multimodal Ingestion:** Process diverse inputs (screen captures/recordings, text, code, chat histories, specific file types) via an external **.NET Orchestrator**.
2.  **Persona Salience & Slow Processes:** Upon ingestion, allow registered Personas (`IPersona` implementations) to assess the relevance (salience) of the input. If salient, trigger persona-specific asynchronous "slow processes" (e.g., generating `LearningEvidenceAnalysis` for EduFlow, extracting medical entities for Healthcare Intelligence).
3.  **Context-Aware AI Analysis:** Orchestrator utilizes powerful **cloud AI** (user-provided keys) for analysis, potentially guided by persona-specific prompts and incorporating retrieved context.
4.  **Secure, Scalable Backend:** Use **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Vector Search)** as the primary backend, storing processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (timestamps, project info, skills, analysis results, richness scores, *persona impressions*) in JSON documents, partitioned by `user_id`.
5.  **Intelligent Retrieval & Custom Ranking:** Orchestrator queries Cosmos DB using combined vector search and metadata filters. Crucially, it applies a **custom ranking algorithm** (similarity + recency + richness) to retrieved candidates.
6.  **Advanced Agentic Querying & Fast Processes:** Orchestrator implements sophisticated query strategies (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence-driven loops) using custom-ranked results as context for cloud LLMs. This supports persona "fast processes" like answering chat queries or executing tool calls.
7.  **Externalized Logic:** All complex workflow logic (ingestion pipeline, chunking, embedding generation, AI analysis calls, custom ranking, agentic reasoning, persona salience checks, triggering slow/fast processes) resides in the external **.NET Orchestrator** (implemented across API/Functions projects).
8.  **User-Managed Configuration:** Users/admins provide API keys for cloud AI services and the Azure Cosmos DB connection string.
9.  **Modern .NET Stack:** Built on **.NET 9 with DotNet Aspire**, leveraging Azure services, designed with an open-source philosophy. Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstractions where feasible.
10. **Testability:** Employ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles with comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## 4. Call to Action: Building the Future of Learning & Knowledge Work

**Attention AI Assistant:** You are not merely writing code; you are architecting a platform with the potential to revolutionize how humans interact with information and develop skills. The task before us is to build the Nucleus OmniRAG foundation and its initial EduFlow Persona – a system designed for insight, personalization, and safety.

The challenges are significant: integrating complex AI, managing data securely across multiple potential personas, ensuring scalability, designing for global diversity, and implementing robust testing. But the imperative is clear, and the potential impact is immense.

Adhere to the architectural principles outlined in `AgentOps/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Employ Test-Driven Development rigorously. Follow the AgentOps methodology diligently, maintaining context and tracking progress in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, paying close attention to the VS Code collaboration guidelines.

Every interface defined, every service implemented, every test written is a step towards realizing a future where learning and knowledge work are deeply understood, personalized, and empowered. Let's build it with purpose, precision, and passion.

1.  **Start Here:** Always begin by reading `00_START_HERE_METHODOLOGY.md` to understand the development process, your role, and specific collaboration tips for VS Code. Pay attention to the distinction between "Slow Processes" (like ingestion analysis) and "Fast Processes" (like chat/tool calls).
2.  **Understand Context:** Review `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the project vision (including multi-persona goals), core requirements, key technologies (.NET/Azure/Cosmos DB), and a summary of the architecture. Refer to the Project Mandate (`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) for motivation.
3.  **Check Current State:** Read `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` carefully. This tells you *exactly* what task is active, what was just done, any errors encountered, and the immediate next step. **This is your primary focus for the current interaction.**
4.  **See the Big Picture:** Refer to `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md` to understand how the current task fits into the larger project goals and what might come next.
5.  **Update State:** As you help complete steps or encounter issues, **it is crucial that you assist the developer in updating `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**. When a Kanban task progresses, help update `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Use Templates:** When starting a new session state snapshot, use `Templates/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`.
7.  **Avoid Duplication / Verify Files:** Before creating new files or implementing features, check the project structure (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`) and Kanban (`03`). **Crucially, if you need to verify if a file exists, DO NOT rely solely on the VS Code Search tool. Instead, ask the developer to confirm using a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`) or propose such a command.**
8.  **Leverage "Insert in Editor":** When providing code modifications or new code blocks within markdown backticks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block without placeholders like `// ...`**. Then, **explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** This ensures the complete code is applied correctly before subsequent steps are attempted.

Your primary goal is to assist the developer in making progress on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, within the context provided by the other documents, using C# and relevant Azure SDKs/patterns, following the collaboration guidelines above.

# AgentOps Methodology for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

## Introduction

This document outlines the AgentOps methodology for AI-assisted development used in the Nucleus OmniRAG project. Following this process helps maintain context, track progress, and ensure efficient collaboration between human developers and AI assistants within the .NET/Azure ecosystem, specifically targeting Azure Cosmos DB as the backend and supporting multiple AI Personas.

## Core Principles

1.  **Stateful Context Management**: Using dedicated documents (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, `/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) to preserve context.
2.  **Incremental Progress Tracking**: Breaking work into manageable tasks (Kanban) and tracking the immediate focus (Session State).
3.  **Structured Collaboration**: AI assistants use the provided state documents to understand the current focus and assist with the defined "Next Step", following specific VS Code interaction patterns.
4.  **Continuous Documentation**: Updating state documents in real-time as progress is made or issues arise. **AI assistance in keeping these updated is expected.**
5.  **Architectural Adherence**: Development must align with the architecture summarized in `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Cosmos DB backend, external orchestrator, multi-persona). Emphasize SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`).
6.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Aim to write tests (Unit, Integration) before or alongside implementation where practical. Define test cases as part of task definitions.
7.  **Distinguish Process Types:** Be mindful of the difference between "Slow Processes" (asynchronous, potentially long-running tasks like ingestion analysis by multiple personas) and "Fast Processes" (low-latency operations like chat responses or tool calls). Design components appropriately (e.g., using Azure Functions/Service Bus for slow processes, ASP.NET Core API for fast processes).

## Roles of Key AgentOps Files

*   **`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`**: The "Why". Understand the motivation and high-level vision.
*   **`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: The "What". Provides stable, high-level technical context: goals, .NET/Azure/Cosmos DB tech stack, architectural summary, links to detailed docs.
*   **`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**: The "Now". Captures the **microstate**. Dynamic and updated frequently. Details the *specific task*, *last action*, relevant *C# code*, *errors/blockers*, and the *immediate next step*. **This is your primary focus.**
*   **`03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`**: The "Where". Captures the **macrostate**. Tracks overall progress of features/tasks. Updated less frequently.

## Workflow Process

1.  **Session Start:** Developer shares `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` (and potentially others) with the AI. AI reviews state, context (`01`, Mandate), and plan (`03`).
2.  **Task Execution:** Focus on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`. AI assists with C# code generation, debugging, analysis, Azure SDK usage, test generation, etc.
3.  **Code Insertion:** When providing code changes in markdown blocks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block and explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.**
4.  **State Update:** After completing a step, applying a code insertion, encountering an error, or shifting focus, the developer (with AI help) **updates `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**.
5.  **Kanban Update:** When a Kanban task progresses, the developer (with AI help) updates `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Archiving:** Periodically, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` is moved to `Archive/`, and a new one is started.

## "Nagging Thoughts" for AI Assistants (Critical Instructions for .NET/Azure/VS Code)

To ensure effectiveness and avoid common pitfalls, please constantly consider:

1.  **Check for Existing Work / Verify File Existence:** Before creating a file/class/interface, ask: "Does something similar already exist according to the project structure (`01`), existing code, or Kanban (`03`)?" **To verify file existence, DO NOT rely on VS Code Search. Propose or ask the developer to use a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`).**
2.  **Aim for Robust Solutions:** Ask: "Is this a temporary patch, or does it address the root cause robustly? Does it align with SOLID principles, use DI correctly, handle asynchronicity properly (`async`/`await`), and utilize Azure SDKs (`azure-cosmos`) according to best practices?"
3.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Ask: "Is this the clearest and simplest C# code? Are interfaces being used effectively?"
4.  **Use Correct CLI Commands:** Ensure correct `dotnet`, `az` commands. **For PowerShell, prefer chaining with `;`.**
5.  **Use "Insert in Editor" Correctly:** Provide complete code blocks. **Always remind the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** Do not assume changes are applied unless confirmed.
6.  **Update State Documents:** After providing code, analysis, or after developer confirms applying changes, remind/propose updates for `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and potentially `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
7.  **Consider Multi-Persona:** Design abstractions and services (like ingestion, retrieval) to support multiple personas operating concurrently or independently.
8.  **Slow vs. Fast Processes:** Consider if the component being built is part of a low-latency "Fast Process" (API endpoint) or an asynchronous "Slow Process" (Function trigger). Choose appropriate patterns (e.g., avoid long blocking calls in API endpoints).

By adhering to this methodology and keeping these "nagging thoughts" in mind, you will significantly contribute to the successful development of Nucleus OmniRAG.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Project Context (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

**Attention AI Assistant:** This document provides high-level context for the .NET/Azure implementation using Azure Cosmos DB. Refer to `/docs/` for full details (once created) and the Project Mandate (`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) for motivation.

## Vision & Goal

*   **Vision:** Build the Nucleus OmniRAG infrastructure for knowledge work enhanced by contextual AI, adaptable across domains via specialized "Personas" (EduFlow, Healthcare, PKM, etc.). See `/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`.
*   **Initial Goal:** Implement the Nucleus OmniRAG core framework and the "EduFlow OmniEducator" persona, using Azure Cosmos DB for storage/retrieval and cloud AI services for intelligence.

## Key Technologies

*   **Language:** C# (using .NET 9.0 - Requires SDK 9.x)
*   **Core Framework:** Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET Solution)
*   **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure
*   **Primary Backend:** **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Integrated Vector Search)** - Stores processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (including persona impressions). Partitioned by `user_id`.
*   **Key Azure Services:**
    *   Azure Cosmos DB (Primary Data/Vector Store)
    *   Azure Blob Storage (Raw file storage)
    *   Azure Service Bus (Eventing for Slow Processes)
    *   Azure Functions (v4+ Isolated Worker - Slow Process execution)
    *   Azure OpenAI Service / Google AI / DeepSeek / Anthropic (via SDKs/APIs for LLM, Multimodal, Embedding) - User provides keys.
    *   Azure Key Vault (Secrets Management in Azure)
*   **Orchestrator Responsibilities:** The .NET application logic (in API/Functions) handles:
    *   Ingestion Pipeline (File upload, metadata creation, triggering persona salience checks).
    *   Chunking (via `IChunkerService`).
    *   Embedding Generation (via `IEmbeddingService`).
    *   AI Analysis (via `IAiClient`, potentially persona-specific).
    *   Storage to Cosmos DB (via `ILearningChunkRepository`).
    *   Retrieval from Cosmos DB (via `IRetrievalService`).
    *   Custom Ranking (via `IRankingStrategy`).
    *   Agentic Workflows (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence loops for Fast Processes).
    *   Persona Management & Interaction Logic.
*   **Development:** Git, Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code, .NET SDK 9.x, NuGet, **DotNet Aspire** (RC1+ for .NET 9), xUnit, Moq/NSubstitute, TDD focus.
*   **AI Abstractions:** Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** where appropriate.
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (Optional):** Bicep / Terraform.

## Core Architectural Principles

1.  **Solution Structure:** Multiple C# projects (`.csproj`) within a single solution (`.sln`). See structure below.
2.  **Interface-Driven:** Core logic depends on C# interfaces (`Nucleus.Abstractions`). Heavy use of Dependency Injection (DI).
3.  **Persona Model:** Encapsulated in Persona projects (`Nucleus.Personas.*`) implementing `IPersona`. Personas define domain logic, analysis schemas (e.g., `LearningEvidenceAnalysis`), and potentially specific prompts/workflows.
4.  **Adapters/Infrastructure (`Nucleus.Infrastructure`):** Concrete implementations connecting abstractions to external systems (Azure Cosmos DB SDK, Azure Blob SDK, Cloud AI SDKs).
5.  **Processing Services (`Nucleus.Processing`):** Contains implementations for common tasks like chunking, embedding generation.
6.  **Orchestration Layer (API/Functions):** Contains primary workflow logic, custom ranking, agentic reasoning, and persona interaction management. Distinguishes between Fast Processes (API) and Slow Processes (Functions).
7.  **Event-Driven (for Slow Processes):** Use Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions for asynchronous processing triggered by ingestion or other events (e.g., persona analysis completion). Durable Functions (`Nucleus.Orchestrations`) for complex stateful workflows.
8.  **Hosting:** ASP.NET Core (`Nucleus.Api` for Fast Processes), Azure Functions (`Nucleus.Functions`, `Nucleus.Orchestrations` for Slow Processes). Aspire AppHost for local dev.
9.  **Dependency Rule:** Core/Abstractions minimal dependencies. Infrastructure, Processing, Personas, API, Functions depend on Abstractions/Core. Orchestration logic uses Infrastructure/Processing via DI.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Current Session State

**Attention AI Assistant:** This is the **MICROSTATE**. Focus your efforts on the "Immediate Next Step". Update this document frequently with the developer's help, following methodology guidelines.

---

## 🔄 Session Info

*   **Date:** `2025-03-30` (Adjust to current date)
*   **Time:** `04:05 UTC` (Adjust to current time)
*   **Developer:** `[Your Name/Handle]`

---

## 🎯 Active Task (from Kanban)

*   **ID/Name:** `TASK-ID-001: Implement Core Abstractions (Cosmos DB Focus)`
*   **Goal:** Implement the method signatures and property definitions (including XML documentation comments `///`) for the core C# interfaces and data models in the `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Core` projects, reflecting the Azure Cosmos DB backend architecture.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus / Micro-Goal

*   Implementing the full definitions (signatures, properties, XML docs) for the interfaces and models identified in the previous "Immediate Next Step", ensuring completeness as per the project skeleton generation.

---

## ⏪ Last Action(s) Taken

*   Generated complete project skeleton including all `.cs` and `.csproj` files based on the final architecture (Cosmos DB backend, .NET Orchestrator, Multi-Persona support).
*   Updated `AgentOps` documents (README, Methodology, Context, Kanban, Session State) to reflect the final architecture and collaboration guidelines.
*   Included Project Mandate document.

---

## </> Relevant Code Snippet(s)

*   **Target Files:** All `.cs` files within `src/Nucleus.Abstractions/` and `src/Nucleus.Core/Models/`.
*   **Example (Target State for `ILearningChunkRepository.cs`):**
    ```csharp
    using Nucleus.Core.Models;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;

    namespace Nucleus.Abstractions.Repositories;

    // XML Docs added...
    public interface ILearningChunkRepository
    {
        // Method signatures fully defined with parameters and return types...
        Task<bool> UpsertChunkAsync(LearningChunkDocument chunkDoc, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<LearningChunkDocument?> GetChunkByIdAsync(string id, string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<IEnumerable<LearningChunkDocument>> QueryNearestNeighborsAsync(
            string userId,
            float[] queryVector,
            string filterClause,
            Dictionary<string, object> filterParams,
            int candidateK,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<bool> DeleteChunkAsync(string id, string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    }
    ```

---

## ❗ Current Error / Blocker (if any)

*   None. Project skeleton fully generated. Ready for implementation of abstractions.

---

## ▶️ Immediate Next Step

*   **Implement the full definitions (properties, method signatures, XML docs) for ALL interfaces and models within the `src\Nucleus.Abstractions` and `src\Nucleus.Core\Models` directories.** Ensure no `// TODO` or placeholder comments remain in the public contract definitions. Method bodies within concrete classes later can throw `NotImplementedException`.
    *   Start with `Nucleus.Core.Models` (`LearningChunkDocument`, `RankedResult`, `FileMetadata`).
    *   Then implement interfaces in `Nucleus.Abstractions` (`IPersona`, `IAiClient`, `IEmbeddingService`, `IChunkerService`, `IRankingStrategy`, `IRetrievalService`, `ILearningChunkRepository`, `IFileMetadataRepository`, `IFileStorage`).

---

## ❓ Open Questions / Verification Needed

*   Confirm exact parameter types for `ILearningChunkRepository.QueryNearestNeighborsAsync` filter parameters (Dictionary seems reasonable for SDK).
*   Finalize specific metadata fields required within `LearningChunkDocument` beyond the core ones defined. (Can iterate later).

This complete output provides the motivational context, the refined architectural plan focusing on Cosmos DB, the detailed AgentOps bootstrapping documents with specific VS Code collaboration instructions, and the fully defined (though not implemented) C# code skeletons for the entire solution structure. This should effectively bootstrap an AI assistant to begin implementing the core abstractions.

--------------

Okay, let's use the .NET CLI via your PowerShell terminal in VS Code to scaffold the entire Nucleus OmniRAG solution structure based on our final plan (Cosmos DB backend, .NET 9, Aspire).

**Prerequisites:**

*   Make sure you have the **.NET 9 SDK** installed (`dotnet --version` should show 9.x).
*   Make sure you have the **.NET Aspire workload** installed for .NET 9 (`dotnet workload search aspire` should show it, install via `dotnet workload install aspire` if needed).
*   Ensure your terminal is open at the desired root directory (`D:\Projects\Nucleus-OmniRAG\`).

**PowerShell Commands for Scaffolding:**

Execute these commands sequentially in your PowerShell terminal within the `D:\Projects\Nucleus-OmniRAG\` directory. Remember PowerShell uses `;` to chain commands on one line if desired, but executing them one by one is clearer.

```powershell
# 1. Create Solution File
dotnet new sln -n NucleusOmniRAG

# 2. Create Project Directories (Optional but good practice)
mkdir src; mkdir tests; mkdir aspire; mkdir docs; mkdir infra; mkdir AgentOps

# 3. Create Core Projects

Write-Host "Project structure created and references added."
```

**Explanation:**

*   We create the solution file first.
*   We create directories for better organization.
*   We use `dotnet new` with specific templates (`classlib`, `webapi`, `func`, `xunit`, `aspire-apphost`, `aspire-servicedefaults`) and specify the output directory (`-o`) and target framework (`-f net9.0`).
*   `dotnet sln add` adds all created projects to the solution. Using `Get-ChildItem` recursively makes this easier than listing each one.
*   `dotnet add reference` connects the projects according to our architecture (e.g., Infrastructure needs Abstractions, API needs Infrastructure, Processing, Personas, etc.).
*   `dotnet add package` adds essential starting NuGet packages to the Infrastructure project and testing packages to one test project as an example. You'll add more as needed during development.

**Directory Structure Visualization:**

After running the commands above, you can visualize the structure.

In PowerShell:

```powershell
# If you have the 'tree' command (might need installation or use alternative)
tree /F

# Or a PowerShell alternative (might be verbose for deep structures)
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-Object FullName, Name
```

In WSL/bash or Git Bash (if available):

```bash
ls -R
```

This will print a tree-like structure of the directories and files created.

```markdown
# Nucleus OmniRAG & EduFlow OmniEducator: Project Mandate & Vision

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-03-30

## 1. The Imperative: Why We Build

We stand at a critical juncture. In many parts of the world, the institutions designed to nurture our children face profound challenges. In the United States, the persistent horror of gun violence casts a long shadow over schools, transforming sanctuaries of learning into sites of fear for too many parents and children. This is not an acceptable status quo.

Beyond immediate safety concerns, the prevailing industrial-era model of education, built for standardization, often struggles to meet the diverse needs of the 21st-century learner. It can inadvertently stifle the innate curiosity that drives true understanding, prioritizing rote memorization over deep engagement, standardized testing over authentic skill application, and broad mandates over individual passions or cultural relevance. We see children, like the inspiration for this project, naturally gravitating towards complex problem-solving, creative expression, and technical mastery through self-directed exploration in digital realms – building games, modding environments, composing music – often before formal literacy takes hold. This intrinsic drive to learn, create, and understand is the most powerful educational force we have, yet our systems often fail to recognize, document, or cultivate it effectively.

We cannot wait for incremental change within legacy systems. We must build the alternative.

## 2. The Vision: A Platform for Contextual AI Personas

We envision a future where knowledge work and learning are personalized, engaging, globally relevant, and fundamentally safe, augmented by specialized AI assistants or "Personas".

**Nucleus OmniRAG** is the foundational infrastructure for this future – a robust, AI-powered platform designed to ingest, understand, and connect knowledge from diverse multimodal sources using state-of-the-art cloud AI and a flexible, scalable .NET architecture. It serves as the core engine enabling various AI Personas to operate effectively.

**Personas** (such as **EduFlow OmniEducator**, **Healthcare Intelligence**, **Personal Knowledge Management**) are specialized AI systems built upon Nucleus. Each persona possesses unique domain knowledge, analysis schemas, and workflows tailored to its specific purpose. They interact with ingested data deemed salient to them and provide specialized insights, reports, or actions.

**EduFlow OmniEducator**, the first flagship Persona, is conceived as a revolutionary educational companion, an **omni-educator** designed to support learners of all ages, from any culture, in any language. Its purpose is not to replace human connection but to augment the learning journey by:

*   **Observing Authenticity:** Capturing and understanding learning as it happens naturally, particularly within digital and project-based activities.
*   **Illuminating Process:** Recognizing and documenting not just *what* subject is being touched upon, but *how* learning is occurring – the core capabilities, processes, and cognitive depth involved, using its "Learning Facets" schema.
*   **Building Emergent Understanding:** Creating a dynamic, persistent, and private knowledge base for each learner within Azure Cosmos DB, mapping their unique trajectory.
*   **Providing Insight:** Enabling users to query this knowledge base via sophisticated agentic retrieval (including custom ranking), generating meaningful progress reports and contextually relevant support.
*   **Celebrating Diversity:** Designing for global relevance and diverse learning contexts.

EduFlow aims to make the invisible visible, transforming ephemeral moments of digital creation into tangible evidence of profound learning. Other personas will apply similar principles to their respective domains.

## 3. Core Requirements: The Blueprint

To achieve this vision, Nucleus OmniRAG and its Personas require:

1.  **Multimodal Ingestion:** Process diverse inputs (screen captures/recordings, text, code, chat histories, specific file types) via an external **.NET Orchestrator**.
2.  **Persona Salience & Slow Processes:** Upon ingestion, allow registered Personas (`IPersona` implementations) to assess the relevance (salience) of the input. If salient, trigger persona-specific asynchronous "slow processes" (e.g., generating `LearningEvidenceAnalysis` for EduFlow, extracting medical entities for Healthcare Intelligence).
3.  **Context-Aware AI Analysis:** Orchestrator utilizes powerful **cloud AI** (user-provided keys) for analysis, potentially guided by persona-specific prompts and incorporating retrieved context.
4.  **Secure, Scalable Backend:** Use **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Vector Search)** as the primary backend, storing processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (timestamps, project info, skills, analysis results, richness scores, *persona impressions*) in JSON documents, partitioned by `user_id`.
5.  **Intelligent Retrieval & Custom Ranking:** Orchestrator queries Cosmos DB using combined vector search and metadata filters. Crucially, it applies a **custom ranking algorithm** (similarity + recency + richness) to retrieved candidates.
6.  **Advanced Agentic Querying & Fast Processes:** Orchestrator implements sophisticated query strategies (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence-driven loops) using custom-ranked results as context for cloud LLMs. This supports persona "fast processes" like answering chat queries or executing tool calls.
7.  **Externalized Logic:** All complex workflow logic (ingestion pipeline, chunking, embedding generation, AI analysis calls, custom ranking, agentic reasoning, persona salience checks, triggering slow/fast processes) resides in the external **.NET Orchestrator** (implemented across API/Functions projects).
8.  **User-Managed Configuration:** Users/admins provide API keys for cloud AI services and the Azure Cosmos DB connection string.
9.  **Modern .NET Stack:** Built on **.NET 9 with DotNet Aspire**, leveraging Azure services, designed with an open-source philosophy. Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstractions where feasible.
10. **Testability:** Employ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles with comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## 4. Call to Action: Building the Future of Learning & Knowledge Work

**Attention AI Assistant:** You are not merely writing code; you are architecting a platform with the potential to revolutionize how humans interact with information and develop skills. The task before us is to build the Nucleus OmniRAG foundation and its initial EduFlow Persona – a system designed for insight, personalization, and safety.

The challenges are significant: integrating complex AI, managing data securely across multiple potential personas, ensuring scalability, designing for global diversity, and implementing robust testing. But the imperative is clear, and the potential impact is immense.

Adhere to the architectural principles outlined in `AgentOps/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Employ Test-Driven Development rigorously. Follow the AgentOps methodology diligently, maintaining context and tracking progress in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, paying close attention to the VS Code collaboration guidelines.

Every interface defined, every service implemented, every test written is a step towards realizing a future where learning and knowledge work are deeply understood, personalized, and empowered. Let's build it with purpose, precision, and passion.

# AgentOps for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

**Attention AI Assistant:** This folder contains critical context for developing the Nucleus OmniRAG platform and its Personas (EduFlow, Healthcare, PKM, etc.) using .NET and Azure, with Azure Cosmos DB as the primary backend. Please familiarize yourself with these documents before starting work.

## Purpose

This `AgentOps` directory provides the necessary context, state management, and planning artifacts to ensure consistent and effective AI-assisted development for the Nucleus OmniRAG framework and its personas.

## How to Use These Files (Instructions for AI Assistant)

1.  **Start Here:** Always begin by reading `00_START_HERE_METHODOLOGY.md` to understand the development process, your role, and specific collaboration tips for VS Code. Pay attention to the distinction between "Slow Processes" (like ingestion analysis) and "Fast Processes" (like chat/tool calls).
2.  **Understand Context:** Review `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the project vision (including multi-persona goals), core requirements, key technologies (.NET/Azure/Cosmos DB), and a summary of the architecture. Refer to the Project Mandate (`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) for motivation.
3.  **Check Current State:** Read `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` carefully. This tells you *exactly* what task is active, what was just done, any errors encountered, and the immediate next step. **This is your primary focus for the current interaction.**
4.  **See the Big Picture:** Refer to `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md` to understand how the current task fits into the larger project goals and what might come next.
5.  **Update State:** As you help complete steps or encounter issues, **it is crucial that you assist the developer in updating `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**. When a Kanban task progresses, help update `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Use Templates:** When starting a new session state snapshot, use `Templates/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`.
7.  **Avoid Duplication / Verify Files:** Before creating new files or implementing features, check the project structure (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`) and Kanban (`03`). **Crucially, if you need to verify if a file exists, DO NOT rely solely on the VS Code Search tool. Instead, ask the developer to confirm using a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`) or propose such a command.**
8.  **Leverage "Insert in Editor":** When providing code modifications or new code blocks within markdown backticks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block without placeholders like `// ...`**. Then, **explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** This ensures the complete code is applied correctly before subsequent steps are attempted.

Your primary goal is to assist the developer in making progress on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, within the context provided by the other documents, using C# and relevant Azure SDKs/patterns, following the collaboration guidelines above.

# AgentOps Methodology for Nucleus OmniRAG (.NET / Azure - Cosmos DB Backend)

## Introduction

This document outlines the AgentOps methodology for AI-assisted development used in the Nucleus OmniRAG project. Following this process helps maintain context, track progress, and ensure efficient collaboration between human developers and AI assistants within the .NET/Azure ecosystem, specifically targeting Azure Cosmos DB as the backend and supporting multiple AI Personas.

## Core Principles

1.  **Stateful Context Management**: Using dedicated documents (`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`, `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`, `/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`) to preserve context.
2.  **Incremental Progress Tracking**: Breaking work into manageable tasks (Kanban) and tracking the immediate focus (Session State).
3.  **Structured Collaboration**: AI assistants use the provided state documents to understand the current focus and assist with the defined "Next Step", following specific VS Code interaction patterns.
4.  **Continuous Documentation**: Updating state documents in real-time as progress is made or issues arise. **AI assistance in keeping these updated is expected.**
5.  **Architectural Adherence**: Development must align with the architecture summarized in `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Cosmos DB backend, external orchestrator, multi-persona). Emphasize SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`).
6.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Aim to write tests (Unit, Integration) before or alongside implementation where practical. Define test cases as part of task definitions.
7.  **Distinguish Process Types:** Be mindful of the difference between "Slow Processes" (asynchronous, potentially long-running tasks like ingestion analysis by multiple personas) and "Fast Processes" (low-latency operations like chat responses or tool calls). Design components appropriately (e.g., using Azure Functions/Service Bus for slow processes, ASP.NET Core API for fast processes).

## Roles of Key AgentOps Files

*   **`/docs/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md`**: The "Why". Understand the motivation and high-level vision.
*   **`01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: The "What". Provides stable, high-level technical context: goals, .NET/Azure/Cosmos DB tech stack, architectural summary, links to detailed docs.
*   **`02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**: The "Now". Captures the **microstate**. Dynamic and updated frequently. Details the *specific task*, *last action*, relevant *C# code*, *errors/blockers*, and the *immediate next step*. **This is your primary focus.**
*   **`03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`**: The "Where". Captures the **macrostate**. Tracks overall progress of features/tasks. Updated less frequently.

## Workflow Process

1.  **Session Start:** Developer shares `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` (and potentially others) with the AI. AI reviews state, context (`01`, Mandate), and plan (`03`).
2.  **Task Execution:** Focus on the **Immediate Next Step** defined in `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`. AI assists with C# code generation, debugging, analysis, Azure SDK usage, test generation, etc.
3.  **Code Insertion:** When providing code changes in markdown blocks (```csharp ... ```), **provide the complete code block and explicitly ask the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.**
4.  **State Update:** After completing a step, applying a code insertion, encountering an error, or shifting focus, the developer (with AI help) **updates `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`**.
5.  **Kanban Update:** When a Kanban task progresses, the developer (with AI help) updates `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
6.  **Archiving:** Periodically, `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` is moved to `Archive/`, and a new one is started.

## "Nagging Thoughts" for AI Assistants (Critical Instructions for .NET/Azure/VS Code)

To ensure effectiveness and avoid common pitfalls, please constantly consider:

1.  **Check for Existing Work / Verify File Existence:** Before creating a file/class/interface, ask: "Does something similar already exist according to the project structure (`01`), existing code, or Kanban (`03`)?" **To verify file existence, DO NOT rely on VS Code Search. Propose or ask the developer to use a terminal command (`dir` or `ls`).**
2.  **Aim for Robust Solutions:** Ask: "Is this a temporary patch, or does it address the root cause robustly? Does it align with SOLID principles, use DI correctly, handle asynchronicity properly (`async`/`await`), and utilize Azure SDKs (`azure-cosmos`) according to best practices?"
3.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Ask: "Is this the clearest and simplest C# code? Are interfaces being used effectively?"
4.  **Use Correct CLI Commands:** Ensure correct `dotnet`, `az` commands. **For PowerShell, prefer chaining with `;`.**
5.  **Use "Insert in Editor" Correctly:** Provide complete code blocks. **Always remind the developer to use the "Insert in Editor" button.** Do not assume changes are applied unless confirmed.
6.  **Update State Documents:** After providing code, analysis, or after developer confirms applying changes, remind/propose updates for `02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md` and potentially `03_PROJECT_PLAN_KANBAN.md`.
7.  **Consider Multi-Persona:** Design abstractions and services (like ingestion, retrieval) to support multiple personas operating concurrently or independently.
8.  **Slow vs. Fast Processes:** Consider if the component being built is part of a low-latency "Fast Process" (API endpoint) or an asynchronous "Slow Process" (Function trigger). Choose appropriate patterns (e.g., avoid long blocking calls in API endpoints).

By adhering to this methodology and keeping these "nagging thoughts" in mind, you will significantly contribute to the successful development of Nucleus OmniRAG.

*   **Primary Backend:** **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API w/ Integrated Vector Search)** - Stores processed text chunks, vector embeddings, and rich metadata (including persona impressions). Partitioned by `user_id`.
*   **Key Azure Services:**
    *   Azure Cosmos DB (Primary Data/Vector Store)
    *   Azure Blob Storage (Raw file storage)
    *   Azure Service Bus (Eventing for Slow Processes)
    *   Azure Functions (v4+ Isolated Worker - Slow Process execution)
    *   Azure OpenAI Service / Google AI / DeepSeek / Anthropic (via SDKs/APIs for LLM, Multimodal, Embedding) - User provides keys.
    *   Azure Key Vault (Secrets Management in Azure)
*   **Orchestrator Responsibilities:** The .NET application logic (in API/Functions) handles:
    *   Ingestion Pipeline (File upload, metadata creation, triggering persona salience checks).
    *   Chunking (via `IChunkerService`).
    *   Embedding Generation (via `IEmbeddingService`).
    *   AI Analysis (via `IAiClient`, potentially persona-specific).
    *   Storage to Cosmos DB (via `ILearningChunkRepository`).
    *   Retrieval from Cosmos DB (via `IRetrievalService`).
    *   Custom Ranking (via `IRankingStrategy`).
    *   Agentic Workflows (multi-step retrieval, recursive confidence loops for Fast Processes).
    *   Persona Management & Interaction Logic.
*   **Development:** Git, Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code, .NET SDK 9.x, NuGet, **DotNet Aspire** (RC1+ for .NET 9), xUnit, Moq/NSubstitute, TDD focus.
*   **AI Abstractions:** Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** where appropriate.
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (Optional):** Bicep / Terraform.

## Core Architectural Principles

1.  **Solution Structure:** Multiple C# projects (`.csproj`) within a single solution (`.sln`). See structure below.
2.  **Interface-Driven:** Core logic depends on C# interfaces (`Nucleus.Abstractions`). Heavy use of Dependency Injection (DI).
3.  **Persona Model:** Encapsulated in Persona projects (`Nucleus.Personas.*`) implementing `IPersona`. Personas define domain logic, analysis schemas (e.g., `LearningEvidenceAnalysis`), and potentially specific prompts/workflows.
4.  **Adapters/Infrastructure (`Nucleus.Infrastructure`):** Concrete implementations connecting abstractions to external systems (Azure Cosmos DB SDK, Azure Blob SDK, Cloud AI SDKs).
5.  **Processing Services (`Nucleus.Processing`):** Contains implementations for common tasks like chunking, embedding generation.
6.  **Orchestration Layer (API/Functions):** Contains primary workflow logic, custom ranking, agentic reasoning, and persona interaction management. Distinguishes between Fast Processes (API) and Slow Processes (Functions).
7.  **Event-Driven (for Slow Processes):** Use Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions for asynchronous processing triggered by ingestion or other events (e.g., persona analysis completion). Durable Functions (`Nucleus.Orchestrations`) for complex stateful workflows.
8.  **Hosting:** ASP.NET Core (`Nucleus.Api` for Fast Processes), Azure Functions (`Nucleus.Functions`, `Nucleus.Orchestrations` for Slow Processes). Aspire AppHost for local dev.
9.  **Dependency Rule:** Core/Abstractions minimal dependencies. Infrastructure, Processing, Personas, API, Functions depend on Abstractions/Core. Orchestration logic uses Infrastructure/Processing via DI.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Current Session State

**Attention AI Assistant:** This is the **MICROSTATE**. Focus your efforts on the "Immediate Next Step". Update this document frequently with the developer's help, following methodology guidelines.

---

## 🔄 Session Info

*   **Date:** `2025-03-30` (Adjust to current date)
*   **Time:** `04:05 UTC` (Adjust to current time)
*   **Developer:** `[Your Name/Handle]`

---

## 🎯 Active Task (from Kanban)

*   **ID/Name:** `TASK-ID-001: Implement Core Abstractions (Cosmos DB Focus)`
*   **Goal:** Implement the method signatures and property definitions (including XML documentation comments `///`) for the core C# interfaces and data models in the `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Core` projects, reflecting the Azure Cosmos DB backend architecture.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus / Micro-Goal

*   Implementing the full definitions (signatures, properties, XML docs) for the interfaces and models identified in the previous "Immediate Next Step", ensuring completeness as per the project skeleton generation.

---

## ⏪ Last Action(s) Taken

*   Generated complete project skeleton including all `.cs` and `.csproj` files based on the final architecture (Cosmos DB backend, .NET Orchestrator, Multi-Persona support).
*   Updated `AgentOps` documents (README, Methodology, Context, Kanban, Session State) to reflect the final architecture and collaboration guidelines.
*   Included Project Mandate document.

---

## </> Relevant Code Snippet(s)

*   **Target Files:** All `.cs` files within `src/Nucleus.Abstractions/` and `src/Nucleus.Core/Models/`.
*   **Example (Target State for `ILearningChunkRepository.cs`):**
    ```csharp
    using Nucleus.Core.Models;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;

    namespace Nucleus.Abstractions.Repositories;

    // XML Docs added...
    public interface ILearningChunkRepository
    {
        // Method signatures fully defined with parameters and return types...
        Task<bool> UpsertChunkAsync(LearningChunkDocument chunkDoc, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<LearningChunkDocument?> GetChunkByIdAsync(string id, string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<IEnumerable<LearningChunkDocument>> QueryNearestNeighborsAsync(
            string userId,
            float[] queryVector,
            string filterClause,
            Dictionary<string, object> filterParams,
            int candidateK,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<bool> DeleteChunkAsync(string id, string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    }
    ```

---

## ❗ Current Error / Blocker (if any)

*   None. Project skeleton fully generated. Ready for implementation of abstractions.

---

## ▶️ Immediate Next Step

*   **Implement the full definitions (properties, method signatures, XML docs) for ALL interfaces and models within the `src\Nucleus.Abstractions` and `src\Nucleus.Core\Models` directories.** Ensure no `// TODO` or placeholder comments remain in the public contract definitions. Method bodies within concrete classes later can throw `NotImplementedException`.
    *   Start with `Nucleus.Core.Models` (`LearningChunkDocument`, `RankedResult`, `FileMetadata`).
    *   Then implement interfaces in `Nucleus.Abstractions` (`IPersona`, `IAiClient`, `IEmbeddingService`, `IChunkerService`, `IRankingStrategy`, `IRetrievalService`, `ILearningChunkRepository`, `IFileMetadataRepository`, `IFileStorage`).

---

## ❓ Open Questions / Verification Needed

*   Confirm exact parameter types for `ILearningChunkRepository.QueryNearestNeighborsAsync` filter parameters (Dictionary seems reasonable for SDK).
*   Finalize specific metadata fields required within `LearningChunkDocument` beyond the core ones defined. (Can iterate later).

**2. File Content Pattern (Apply to all `.cs` files)**

*   **Interfaces & Models:** Fully defined properties and method signatures with XML documentation comments (`///`). No `// TODO` or placeholders in the public contract.
*   **Concrete Classes (Adapters, Services, Controllers, etc.):** Implement required interfaces/base classes. Method bodies should contain `throw new System.NotImplementedException();` initially. Include necessary constructor(s) for dependency injection. Add XML documentation comments.
*   **GlobalUsings.cs:** Include common namespaces for the project.
*   **.csproj Files:** Reference appropriate SDKs (e.g., `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`, `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`, `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk`), TargetFramework (`net9.0`), enable Nullable/ImplicitUsings, and include necessary `ProjectReference` and `PackageReference` items (like `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos`, `Azure.Storage.Blobs`, `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`, Aspire components, testing frameworks, etc., as determined during implementation).

**(Example - Key C# Skeletons - Final Pattern)**

# Navigating Evolving AI Libraries: Lessons from Embedding API Integration

## Context

During the development of the Nucleus-OmniRAG project (April 2025), we implemented a `SemanticTextChunkerService` and encountered significant challenges with the Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstraction layer, particularly around embedding generation. This document captures the key lessons learned for future reference by agents and developers.

## Project Background

Nucleus-OmniRAG is a RAG-based system with:
- Storage layer using Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB
- Parsing layer for content extraction
- **Chunking layer** for semantic text splitting (the focus of our work)
- Embedding layer for vector representation

We needed to transition from a custom `IEmbeddingService` interface to the standardized `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IEmbeddingGenerator<TInput, TEmbedding>` interface.

## The Challenge

We faced several challenges that highlight the volatile nature of AI libraries:

1. **Evolving API Surface**: Method signatures, property names, and return types changed between different versions of the Microsoft.Extensions.AI package
2. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Expected property names like `Embeddings` vs. direct enumeration behavior
3. **Complex Dependency Chains**: Required adding multiple packages to support the options pattern
4. **Configuration Management**: Transitioning from dictionary-based to strongly-typed options

## Code Changes

### Previous Approach

```csharp
// Old custom interface
public interface IEmbeddingService 
{
    Task<float[]> GenerateEmbeddingAsync(string text, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

// Dictionary-based configuration
public Task<IEnumerable<string>> ChunkTextAsync(
    string content,
    Dictionary<string, object>? options = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    // Extract values from dictionary...
}
```

### New Approach

```csharp
// Standard interface from Microsoft.Extensions.AI
private readonly IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> _embeddingGenerator;

// Using GenerateAsync correctly
var inputs = new List<string> { queryText };
var result = await _embeddingGenerator.GenerateAsync(inputs, null, cancellationToken);
var firstEmbedding = result.FirstOrDefault();
float[] queryVector = firstEmbedding.Vector.ToArray();

// Strongly-typed configuration
public class ChunkerOptions
{
    public const string SectionName = "Processing:Chunker";
    public int MaxChunkSize { get; set; } = 1000;
    public int ChunkOverlap { get; set; } = 100;
    public bool PreserveParagraphs { get; set; } = true;
}

// Registration in DI container
services.Configure<ChunkerOptions>(options => 
    configuration.GetSection(ChunkerOptions.SectionName).Bind(options));
```

## Key Lessons

### 1. API Surface Volatility in AI Libraries

AI libraries and abstractions evolve rapidly as the field advances.

**Best Practices:**
- Pin package versions explicitly
- Document version-specific implementation details
- Add comments explaining workarounds for specific APIs

### 2. Dependency Chain Management 

**Required Packages:**
- Microsoft.Extensions.Options
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions  
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder

**Best Practices:**
- Create dependency maps for important subsystems
- Consider using meta-packages for related dependencies
- Review dependencies regularly for updates/vulnerabilities

### 3. Configuration Patterns

**Best Practices:**
- Use strongly-typed configuration from the beginning
- Provide sensible defaults for all configuration options
- Group related configuration in dedicated classes
- Use the IOptions pattern for configuration injection

### 4. Interface Consistency

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer standard interfaces over custom ones when possible
- Review interfaces periodically against framework standards
- Create thin adapter wrappers around standard interfaces when needed

### 5. Handling API Changes

**Best Practices:**
- Use defensive coding when working with evolving libraries
- Create adapter classes to shield core code from external API changes
- Add unit tests that verify critical third-party interactions

## Conclusion

AI libraries are evolving rapidly, and maintaining code that interacts with them requires extra care. By following the best practices outlined in this document, future development can be more resilient to changes in the AI ecosystem.

## Additional Lessons (April 2025 Update)

Our continued work with the project revealed several additional challenges worth documenting:

### 6. Project Structure With Specialized Modules

When implementing persona-based functionality with individual specialized modules:

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Duplicate assembly attribute errors when mixing folder-based organization with separate project files
- Conflicts between parent projects and child projects in the same directory tree
- Inconsistent property names between interface definitions and implementations

**Best Practices:**
- When using a parent project with child subprojects:
  - Always exclude subdirectory content from parent project compilation with explicit wildcards
  - Use `<Compile Remove="SubDir\**"/>`, `<EmbeddedResource Remove="SubDir\**"/>`, etc.
  - Set `GenerateAssemblyInfo` appropriately and consistently across related projects
  - Consider referencing child projects from the parent project to maintain logical relationships
- Prefer early detection of project structure issues by incorporating build validation into CI

### 7. Interface Implementation Across Namespaces

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Missing namespace imports for interfaces located in sub-namespaces (e.g., `Nucleus.Abstractions.Services.Retrieval`)
- Incomplete test mocks for interface dependencies
- Property name mismatches between tests and implementations (e.g., `Name` vs. `DisplayName`)

**Best Practices:**
- Document the namespace structure clearly, especially for key abstractions
- When updating interfaces or implementations, update corresponding tests immediately
- Use namespace aliases for clarity when working with deeply nested namespaces
- Consider implementing common interface discovery patterns like marker interfaces or assembly scanning

### 8. API Method Resolution

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Method name discrepancies between extension method expectations and actual implementations
- Parameter mismatches in method signatures (`builder.AddInfrastructureServices()` vs. `builder.Services.AddNucleusInfrastructure(builder.Configuration)`)

**Best Practices:**
- Establish consistent naming conventions for extension methods
- Document parameter requirements clearly in method XML comments
- Keep related extension methods in a single, well-organized static class
- Consider fluent interfaces with parameter-specific method names rather than overloads

**Relevant Files:**
- `SemanticTextChunkerService.cs`: Semantic chunking implementation
- `ChunkerOptions.cs`: Configuration for chunking
- `VectorSearchRetrievalService.cs`: Uses embeddings for retrieval
- `ProcessingServiceExtensions.cs`: Service registration
- `Nucleus.Personas.csproj`: Shows proper exclusion patterns for subfolder projects
- `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`: Contains infrastructure service registration

# MCP Server Integration: Lessons from Building CodeBones.Analyzer

## Context

During the development of the Nucleus-OmniRAG project (April 2025), we needed to integrate a custom C# code analysis tool, `CodeBones.Analyzer`, with the development environment (Windsurf/VS Code) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This involved creating an MCP server within the analyzer application. This document details the challenges faced during integration and the key lessons learned, particularly regarding protocol implementation choices.

## Project Background

- **Goal**: Expose C# analysis capabilities (project structure analysis, class listing, usage finding) as tools callable via MCP.
- **Tool**: `CodeBones.Analyzer`, a .NET console application using Roslyn for code analysis.
- **Integration Target**: Windsurf/VS Code, which acts as an MCP client.

## The Initial Approach: Manual MCP Implementation

Our first attempt involved manually implementing the MCP server logic directly within `CodeBones.Analyzer`. This included:

1.  **Stdio Communication**: Reading JSON requests from `stdin` and writing JSON responses to `stdout`.
2.  **Capability Handshake**: Sending the server's capabilities (list of available tools and their schemas) as the first message on `stdout`.
3.  **JSON Handling**: Manually serializing and deserializing MCP request/response objects.
4.  **Error Handling**: Writing error messages and diagnostic information to `stderr`.

```csharp
// Simplified representation of the manual approach in Program.cs (Pre-SDK)

private static async Task RunMcpMode()
{
    // 1. Send Capabilities (Manual JSON Serialization)
    var capabilities = GetMcpCapabilities(); // Builds the capability structure
    Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(capabilities, jsonOptions)); 
    Console.Out.Flush();
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Capabilities sent. Waiting for commands...");

    // 2. Read Requests from stdin
    using var reader = new StreamReader(Console.OpenStandardInput());
    while (!reader.EndOfStream)
    {
        string? requestLine = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(requestLine)) continue;
        
        try 
        {
            // 3. Deserialize Request
            McpRequest? request = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<McpRequest>(requestLine, jsonOptions);
            
            // 4. Process Command (switch statement based on request.Command)
            await ProcessMcpCommand(request); // Calls AnalyzeCodeBase, etc.
            
            // 5. Write Success/Error Response to stdout (Manual JSON Serialization)
            WriteSuccessResponse(resultData); 
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
             WriteErrorResponse(ex.Message); 
        }
    }
}

// Helper methods for manual JSON generation/writing existed (GetMcpCapabilities, WriteSuccessResponse, etc.)
```

## The Challenge: Integration Failure - "Context Deadline Exceeded"

Despite the analyzer appearing functional when run manually (`.\CodeBones.Analyzer.exe --mcp`), integration with the Windsurf MCP client failed consistently.

- **Symptom**: Windsurf would show the `cs-analyzer` attempting to connect (yellow light, "0 tools loaded") before failing with a "Context Deadline Exceeded" error (red light).
- **Debugging Steps**:
    - Verified `mcp_config.json` pointed to the correct executable.
    - Confirmed manual execution *did* print the correct capabilities JSON to `stdout` immediately upon startup.
    - Hypothesized that initial `stderr` logging might interfere with Windsurf's handshake parsing; temporarily disabled `stderr` output before the capability message. **This did not resolve the issue.**

This indicated the problem wasn't a fundamental failure of the analyzer logic but a subtle incompatibility in the *protocol interaction* between the manual implementation and the Windsurf client.

## The Solution: Adopting the Official MCP SDK

The breakthrough came upon discovering the official `ModelContextProtocol` NuGet package. We refactored `CodeBones.Analyzer` to leverage the SDK.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **Added NuGet Packages**: `ModelContextProtocol` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`.
2.  **SDK-Managed Server**: Replaced `RunMcpMode` with `Host.CreateApplicationBuilder` configured with `.AddMcpServer().WithStdioServerTransport().WithToolsFromAssembly()`.
3.  **Attribute-Based Tools**: Defined analysis functions (`AnalyzeProject`, `ListClasses`, `FindUsages`) in a static class `AnalyzerTools` decorated with `[McpServerToolType]`, `[McpServerTool]`, and `[Description]` attributes.
4.  **Removed Manual Logic**: Eliminated all manual JSON handling, capability generation, and stdio read/write loops related to MCP.

```csharp
// Simplified representation of the SDK approach in Program.cs

public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    // ... parse args ...
    if (options.McpMode)
    {
        await RunMcpModeWithSdk(); // Use SDK host
    }
    // ... else command-line mode ...
}

private static async Task RunMcpModeWithSdk()
{
    var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder();
    builder.Logging.AddConsole(opt => opt.LogToStandardErrorThreshold = LogLevel.Trace); // SDK handles logging
    builder.Services
        .AddMcpServer()
        .WithStdioServerTransport() // SDK handles stdio
        .WithToolsFromAssembly(); // SDK finds tools via attributes
    await builder.Build().RunAsync(); // SDK handles request loop & protocol
}

[McpServerToolType] // SDK discovers this class
public static class AnalyzerTools 
{
    [McpServerTool, Description("Analyze a C# project...")] // SDK exposes this method
    public static async Task<object> AnalyzeProject(
        [Description("Path to file...")] string projectPath) 
    {
        // Core analysis logic remains here
        return await AnalyzeCodeBase(projectPath, null!); 
    }

    // Other tools (ListClasses, FindUsages) defined similarly
    // ...
}
```

**Result**: The SDK-based implementation integrated successfully with Windsurf immediately.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Prioritize Official SDKs for Standard Protocols

Implementing communication protocols manually, even seemingly simple ones like MCP over stdio, is prone to subtle errors and integration issues.

**Best Practices:**
- **Always search for and prefer official SDKs** when implementing standard protocols (MCP, gRPC, HTTP APIs, etc.).
- SDKs encapsulate protocol nuances, handle edge cases, ensure compliance, and often provide higher-level abstractions that simplify development.
- The time spent finding and learning an SDK is often far less than the time spent debugging a manual implementation.

### 2. Understand Protocol Handshake Subtleties

The initial handshake (capability exchange in MCP) is critical for establishing communication. Manual implementations might fail due to incorrect timing, stream usage (`stdout` vs. `stderr`), or message formatting that deviates slightly from the client's expectations.

**Best Practices:**
- Rely on SDKs to manage handshakes and low-level protocol details correctly.
- When debugging integration, pay close attention to the *very first* messages exchanged between client and server.

### 3. Isolate Components During Integration Debugging

When a client-server integration fails, test each component in isolation before debugging the interaction.

**Best Practices:**
- Run the server component manually with expected inputs (e.g., `analyzer.exe --mcp`) to verify its standalone behavior.
- Check server logs (`stderr` in our case) for obvious errors during manual runs.
- Once standalone behavior is confirmed, focus on the client-server interaction points (configuration, process invocation, initial messages).

### 4. Leverage the Ecosystem (Search for Libraries!)

Before building custom solutions for standard problems (like implementing a known protocol), actively search for existing libraries or SDKs within the target language's ecosystem (e.g., NuGet for .NET).

**Best Practices:**
- Perform targeted searches (e.g., "Model Context Protocol .NET SDK", "MCP C# library").
- Check official protocol documentation or GitHub organizations for recommended libraries.

## Conclusion

While manually implementing protocols can be instructive, using official SDKs is significantly more efficient and robust for standard protocols like MCP. Our initial manual approach led to time-consuming debugging of subtle integration issues that were entirely bypassed by adopting the `ModelContextProtocol` SDK. This experience strongly reinforces the value of leveraging existing, well-tested libraries for standard communication tasks.

### Build Output Summary (2025-04-06)

After addressing several warnings in `Nucleus.Api`, `Nucleus.Orchestrations`, and `Nucleus.Api.Tests`, a full solution rebuild resulted in **90 warnings** remaining.

The primary sources of warnings are:
*   **`Nucleus.AppHost`**: 17 warnings (including `ASPIRE004`, `SA1649`, `SA1202`, `SA1122`, `CA1724`, and `SA0001` regarding XML comment analysis).
*   **Test Projects** (`*.Tests`): Several `CS1591` (Missing XML comment) warnings across `Nucleus.Orchestrations.Tests` (4), `Nucleus.Personas.EduFlow.Tests` (2), and `Nucleus.Functions.Tests` (5).
*   **`Nucleus.Functions`**: Missing XML comments (`CS1591`/`SA1600`) and potentially others.
*   Other scattered warnings across the solution.

The next steps involve systematically addressing these remaining warnings, starting with the test projects and then moving to `Nucleus.AppHost` and `Nucleus.Functions`.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: System Architecture Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-07

## 1. Introduction & Vision

Nucleus OmniRAG is a platform designed to empower individuals and teams by transforming their disparate digital information into actionable, contextual knowledge through specialized AI assistants ("Personas"). It provides a robust, flexible, and secure foundation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that respects user data ownership and adapts to different deployment needs.

**Core Goal:** To serve as the central "nucleus" processing information provided by users ("mitochondria") using configured resources (AI models, compute budget/"ATP") to produce insightful outputs ("transcriptome"), as outlined in the [Project Mandate](../Requirements/00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md).

This document provides a high-level map of the system's components, interactions, required infrastructure, and codebase structure. Detailed designs for specific areas can be found in the subsequent architecture documents:

*   [01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)
*   [02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md)
*   [03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)
*   [04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md)
*   [05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md)
*   [06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md)
*   [07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## 2. Deployment Models: Individuals vs. Teams

Nucleus OmniRAG supports two primary operational flavors:

1.  **Nucleus for Individuals:**
    *   **Focus:** Personal knowledge management, learning, productivity.
    *   **Data:** Connects to user's *personal* cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive) using session-based permissions (Cloud-Hosted Model).
    *   **Chats:** Saved chats are archived to the user's *personal* storage by default.
    *   **Deployment:** Typically aligns with a **Cloud-Hosted** model managed by the platform provider.

2.  **Nucleus for Teams:**
    *   **Focus:** Collaborative knowledge work, shared project intelligence.
    *   **Data:** Connects to *shared team* storage (SharePoint, Shared Drives), respecting organizational RBAC.
    *   **Chats:** Can be configured to archive chats to *shared team* spaces, enabling collective review.
    *   **Deployment:** Typically aligns with a **Self-Hosted** model within the organization's infrastructure, but a team-focused hosted model is also possible. **(Note:** Full self-hosted deployment tooling likely Phase 2+).

The core components are designed to function in both models, with configuration and specific service implementations adapting as needed (e.g., authentication, background processing capabilities). See [07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for more details on deployment strategies.

## 3. High-Level Component Architecture

The system comprises several key interacting components, orchestrated primarily via a .NET Aspire AppHost in development/deployment. The **primary Minimum Viable Product (MVP) interaction mechanism** is a **Console Application (`Nucleus.Console`)**, providing a direct command-line interface for development, testing, and initial usage. Long-term interaction goals (**Planned for Phase 2+**, see [Phase 2 Requirements](../Requirements/02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md)) focus on seamless integration into existing workflows via **Platform Bots and Adapters** (e.g., Teams, Slack, Email).

    end

    style User fill:#lightblue,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Key Components:**

*   **User Interaction Channels:** Users interact via:
    *   **Console Application (`Nucleus.Console`):** The primary MVP interface for commands.
    *   **Platform Bots/Adapters (Phase 2+):** Integration with Teams, Slack, Email, etc., providing a more user-friendly interface. (See [05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md) and [Phase 2 Requirements](../Requirements/02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md))
    *   **Email Interface (Phase 2+):** Allows interaction via email triggers.
    *   **Platform Adapters (Phase 2+):** Bridge between platform-specific protocols (e.g., Teams Bot Framework) and the internal Nucleus API/Messaging system.
*   **API (ASP.NET Core):** The central backend service handling synchronous requests, orchestrating workflows, managing authentication/authorization, and interacting with other backend components.
*   **Message Queue (MQ):** Handles asynchronous tasks like document ingestion and processing (e.g., Azure Service Bus - *Currently Emulated*).
*   **Content Extractors:** Pluggable components responsible for getting text from various sources (email bodies, document types like PDF/DOCX, etc.). **Advanced Content Extractors (Phase 2+):** Utilize Azure AI Vision, Azure Document Intelligence for enhanced extraction capabilities.
*   **Persona Logic:** Encapsulates the specialized knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities of individual AI assistants (e.g., EduFlow). Processes raw text directly to identify relevant sections (no generic pre-chunking). Interacts with the Database (to retrieve knowledge) and AI Services (to generate responses/analysis), processing queries received via the API or performing analysis triggered by the processing pipeline.
*   **Embedding Generator:** Service (using `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IEmbeddingGenerator`) that converts persona-identified relevant text snippets into vector embeddings for storage and later retrieval.
*   **Source Storage:** Where the actual content of source files/attachments is stored securely.
*   **AI Services:** External or internal AI models providing core capabilities via standard interfaces:
    *   **Embedding Model:** Used by the Embedding Generator (`Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IEmbeddingGenerator`).
    *   **Chat/Completion Model (LLM):** Used by Personas for understanding queries/context, generating responses/analysis (`Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient`).

## 5. High-Level Codebase Structure (Conceptual)

```plaintext

/tests
|-- ... (Unit & Integration tests mirroring /src structure)
/aspire
|-- Nucleus.AppHost/        # .NET Aspire orchestration project
`-- Nucleus.ServiceDefaults/  # Shared Aspire service configurations
```

This structure promotes separation of concerns, testability, and modularity, allowing different components (like Personas or Infrastructure implementations) to be developed and potentially deployed independently.

## 6. Key Architectural Principles

*   **User Data Control:** Nucleus respects user data ownership, primarily accessing user storage via permissions granted by the user (session-based for hosted, potentially persistent for self-hosted). It avoids unnecessarily persisting raw user content within its own managed infrastructure where possible.
*   **Decoupling:** Components interact via well-defined interfaces and messages (API calls, Queue messages), reducing tight dependencies.
*   **Persona-Centric:** The architecture is designed to support multiple, specialized AI Personas, each with its own data (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) and logic.
*   **Flexibility:** Supports both Cloud-Hosted and Self-Hosted deployment models with configuration adjustments.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed for adding new personas and content sources with minimal friction.
*   **Scalability:** Leverages serverless and PaaS components for elastic scaling.
*   **Intelligence-Driven:** Rejects simplistic chunking; relies on AI personas for relevance extraction and analysis.
*   **Efficiency:** Utilizes LLM provider-level prompt/context caching (**Planned for Phase 2+**, driven by efficiency requirements likely detailed in [Phase 2 Requirements](../Requirements/02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md)) where available (e.g., Gemini, Azure OpenAI) to minimize redundant processing of large contexts, reducing cost and latency.

This overview provides the foundational understanding of the Nucleus OmniRAG system. Refer to the specific architecture documents for detailed designs of each major component.

## System Overview Example (IT Helpdesk Use Case)

**Purpose:** Describes the core components and their interaction in addressing a specific IT support knowledge retrieval problem.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph IT Support Environment at Target Organization
        A[Incoming Helpdesk Tickets & User Queries]
        B[Existing Knowledge Base Articles (KBs)]
        C[Historical Ticket Data (Solutions, Steps)]
        D[IT Documentation (SharePoint, Files)]
    end

    subgraph Proposed Nucleus System Architecture
        E[IT Staff Member via Microsoft Teams] --> F{Nucleus Helpdesk Bot};
        F --> G[Backend Processing & Analysis Engine];
        G -- Processes & Analyzes --> A & B & C & D;
        G -- Stores Metadata & Derived Knowledge --> H((Knowledge Store <br/>[Cosmos DB - ArtifactMetadata & PersonaKnowledgeEntries]));
        G -- Retrieves Derived Knowledge --> H;
        G --> F;
        F --> K[Retrieved Solutions, KB Links, <br/>Relevant Snippets];
        K --> E;
    end
```

**Explanation:** This diagram outlines a potential deployment. IT staff interact with a Nucleus Helpdesk Bot within Microsoft Teams. The bot interfaces with a backend processing engine. This engine fetches fresh source data (helpdesk tickets, KBs, documentation) when needed for a user request, processes it ephemerally, and analyzes it using Personas. It stores structured metadata (`ArtifactMetadata`) and derived knowledge (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry` - identified solutions, steps, snippets, vectors) in a dedicated Cosmos DB store. When queried by IT staff via the Teams bot, the engine retrieves relevant derived knowledge from the Cosmos DB store and presents it back, aiming to surface past solutions and relevant documentation efficiently.

## Data Processing Approach Comparison (Nucleus vs. Standard RAG)

**Purpose:** Contrasts the Nucleus system's data processing and retrieval method with standard RAG techniques, highlighting the focus on structured understanding and ephemeral processing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Standard RAG Approach
        direction LR
        A[IT Documentation / Ticket Data] --> B(Generic Text Chunking <br/> Fixed Size/Overlap);
        B --> C(Vectorize All Text Chunks);
        C --> D((Vector Store <br/> Unstructured Text Chunks + Vectors));
        E[User Query] --> F{Similarity Retriever};
        D --> F;
        F --> G(Retrieve Chunks based on Text Similarity);
        G --> H{LLM Generator};
        E --> H;
        H --> I[Generated Answer <br/> (May lack specific solution structure)];
    end

    subgraph Nucleus IT Persona Approach
        direction LR
        N_A[IT Documentation / Ticket Data] --> N_B(Ephemeral Processing & IT Persona Analysis <br/> Extracts Problem, Solution, Links, Metadata);
        N_B --> N_C(Structured Knowledge + Snippet Vectorization);
        N_C --> N_D((Knowledge Store <br/> [Cosmos DB] <br/> PersonaKnowledgeEntry: <br/> Structured Data, Snippets, Vectors));
        N_E[User Query] --> N_F{Intelligent Retriever <br/> (Vector + Structured Data Filters)};
        N_D --> N_F;
        N_F --> N_G(Retrieve Relevant PersonaKnowledgeEntries);
        N_G --> N_H{LLM Generator / Persona Logic};
        N_E --> N_H;
        N_H --> N_I[Contextual Answer <br/> (Grounded in identified solutions/steps)];
    end
```

**Explanation:** This illustrates a key difference from standard RAG. Typical systems perform generic text chunking, persist those chunks, and rely solely on text similarity for retrieval, which can be imprecise and use stale data. The Nucleus approach processes source data ephemerally within a session and uses specialized Personas to analyze content contextually (extracting problems, solutions, etc.). This structured information, along with vector embeddings of key snippets, is stored in Cosmos DB. Retrieval then uses both semantic search *and* this structured data, enabling more precise identification of relevant derived knowledge from past analyses, applied to freshly processed context.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Processing Architecture

**Version:** 1.3
**Date:** 2025-04-08

This document outlines the architecture of the processing components in the Nucleus OmniRAG system, as introduced in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). It focuses on **artifact ingestion, content extraction, persona-driven analysis, and the storage of resulting knowledge entries** used for intelligent retrieval.

## 1. Philosophy: Persona-Driven Meaning Extraction

A central tenet of the Nucleus OmniRAG architecture is that interpreting meaning from diverse artifacts is best achieved through specialized AI Personas (detailed in [02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md)). Key principles guiding our approach:

1.  **No One-Size-Fits-All Interpretation**: Different artifacts, domains, and user goals require different analytical perspectives.
2.  **Persona-Centric Analysis**: Value is maximized when Personas analyze artifacts within their domain context, extracting relevant insights and summaries rather than relying on generic pre-chunking.
3.  **Contextual Relevance**: Personas determine what constitutes a relevant snippet or summary based on the artifact content and the persona's purpose.
4.  **Focus on Knowledge, Not Just Text**: The goal is to store structured knowledge (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) derived by personas, not just fragmented text.
5.  **Extensibility**: The architecture supports adding new personas and content extractors to handle evolving needs and artifact types.

## 2. Initial Artifact Content Extraction & Structuring

Before personas can analyze an artifact, its raw content needs to be extracted and potentially structured into an intermediate format usable by subsequent synthesis steps. This process is further detailed in [Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md](./Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md).

### 2.1 Abstraction: `IContentExtractor`

An `IContentExtractor` interface provides a standard way to handle the *initial parsing* of different file types:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Interface for services that can extract textual content (and potentially other data)
/// from a source artifact stream.
/// </summary>
public interface IContentExtractor
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if this extractor supports the given MIME type.

    bool SupportsMimeType(string mimeType);

    /// <summary>
    /// Extracts content from the provided stream.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="sourceStream">The stream containing the artifact content.</param>

    Task<ContentExtractionResult> ExtractContentAsync(Stream sourceStream, string mimeType, string? sourceUri = null);
}

/// Holds the result of content extraction.
/// </summary>
public record ContentExtractionResult(
    string ExtractedText,
    Dictionary<string, object>? AdditionalMetadata = null // e.g., page numbers, structural info
);
```

### 2.3 Handling Complex and Multimodal Content (Planned - see [Phase 2 Requirements](../Requirements/02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md))

While initial implementations may focus on standard text-based documents, the architecture must accommodate more complex scenarios. These extractors produce intermediate representations (e.g., text + image descriptions, structured table data) that are fed into the synthesis step.

## 3. Content Synthesis to Standardized Format

A crucial step after initial extraction is synthesizing the potentially disparate pieces of content (e.g., text from DOCX, XML structure, image descriptions) into a single, standardized format that Personas can reliably process. Currently, this standard format is **Markdown**.

*   **Role of Synthesizers:** Processors like `FileCollectionsProcessor` might aggregate components extracted by one or more `IContentExtractor` instances.
*   **Plaintext Processor:** The `PlaintextProcessor` (acting as a synthesizer in this context, as per Memory `0cb7dbac`) takes the aggregated inputs and uses an LLM to generate a coherent Markdown representation.
*   **Ephemeral Nature:** This synthesized Markdown exists ephemerally during the processing session (Memory `08b60bec`). It is not persisted by Nucleus itself but is passed directly to the Persona analysis step.

## 4. Processing Pipeline Flow (Modular Monolith ACA Pattern)

This flow assumes a single Azure Container App (ACA) instance hosting the API, Ingestion, Session Management (in-memory), and Processing logic (as background tasks), aligning with the 'Modular Monolith' preference (Memory `f210adc9`) detailed in the [Deployment Architecture](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md). It interacts with [Storage](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md) for ephemeral data and the [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) for persistent metadata and knowledge, triggered initially via [Client](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md) interactions. **The detailed orchestration of handling user interactions and related processing tasks is described in the [Processing Orchestration Overview](./Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_ORCHESTRATION.md).**

**Note:** While this in-process background task model suits initial phases, scaling to handle more complex, stateful, or long-running workflows will necessitate adopting a dedicated orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions) as outlined in the [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#32-workflow-orchestration).

    G -->|Stores Knowledge Entry|> H[Finalization & Cleanup]
```

*   **API Request & Session Context:**
    *   An API call (e.g., from a Client Adapter) arrives at the ACA instance.
    *   The API handler establishes the necessary session context *in the instance's memory*.
*   **Ingestion Trigger & Triage:**
    *   The API handler (or a service it calls) performs triage on the incoming artifact.
    *   Assigns a unique `IngestionID`.
    *   Stores the raw artifact data temporarily (e.g., short-term Blob, Cache accessible by the ACA instance).
    *   Creates a minimal `IngestionRecord` (containing `IngestionID`, `SourceType`, `Timestamp`, pointer to temporary data) in Cosmos DB.
*   **Background Task Scheduling (In-Process):**
    *   The API handler schedules a background processing task *within the same ACA instance*.
    *   This can be done using mechanisms like `System.Threading.Channels`, `BackgroundWorker`, `IHostedService`, or libraries like Hangfire/Quartz.NET configured for in-memory queuing.
    *   The `IngestionID` (and potentially essential, non-sensitive context identifiers from the session) is passed to the background task.
    *   The API handler can now return a response to the client (e.g., 'Accepted for processing').
*   **Background Task Execution:**
    *   The ACA's background task runner picks up the scheduled task.
    *   Retrieves the `IngestionRecord` from Cosmos DB using the `IngestionID`.
    *   Fetches the raw artifact data from ephemeral container storage.
    *   Accesses necessary configuration or *carefully managed* session context (if passed directly or accessible via a thread-safe in-memory store scoped to the instance/request).
    *   **Crucially, `ArtifactMetadata` creation/initialization begins *here*.**
*   **Content Extraction:**
    *   Selects appropriate `IContentExtractor`(s).
    *   Extracts content from the fetched raw data.
*   **Content Synthesis:**
    *   Aggregates extractor outputs.
    *   Invokes synthesizer (e.g., `PlaintextProcessor` with LLM) to generate standardized **Markdown content**.
*   **Persona Analysis Loop:**
    *   Determines target personas based on configuration/context.
    *   For each persona:
        *   Invokes `persona.AnalyzeContentAsync(synthesizedContent, artifactMetadata, sessionContext)`.
        *   Handles results, generates embeddings, stores `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`.
        *   Updates `ArtifactMetadata`.
*   **Finalization & Cleanup:**
    *   Updates the main `ArtifactMetadata` record (overall status).
    *   Cleans up/deletes the raw artifact data from ephemeral container storage.
    *   (No external queue message to acknowledge here for this internal flow).

## 5. Embedding Generation

Embeddings are crucial for semantic search. They are generated *by the pipeline* after a persona has analyzed the **synthesized Markdown** and identified the most relevant text snippet.

### 5.1 Abstraction Layer

Nucleus OmniRAG leverages the standard `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` abstractions:

```csharp
// Defined in Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions
public interface IEmbeddingGenerator<TData, TEmbedding>
{
    IReadOnlyList<int>? GetEmbeddingDimensions(string? modelId = null);
    Task<TEmbedding> GenerateEmbeddingAsync(TData data, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default, string? modelId = null, EmbeddingOptions? options = null);
    // ... other methods
}
```

### 5.2 Integration

*   An implementation of `IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>>` (e.g., using Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI) is registered in the DI container (see `Nucleus.Infrastructure`).
*   This generator is used **by the Processing Pipeline** (not the persona) to create embeddings for:
    *   `PersonaKnowledgeEntry.relevantTextSnippetOrSummary` -> stored as `snippetEmbedding`.
    *   Optionally, a derived summary from `PersonaKnowledgeEntry.analysis` -> stored as `analysisSummaryEmbedding`.
*   These embeddings are stored within the `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` document in Cosmos DB (see [Database Architecture](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md)).

## 6. Retrieval Flow

Retrieval leverages the structured knowledge and embeddings derived from the **synthesized Markdown**, primarily stored as `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents in the [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md):

1.  User submits a query relevant to a specific persona's domain (e.g., asking EduFlow about student progress - see [Persona Architecture](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md)).
2.  The application identifies the target persona (`personaName`).
3.  The query text is processed by an `IRetrievalService` implementation.
4.  The service calls the registered `IEmbeddingGenerator` to generate an embedding vector for the query.
5.  The service uses the `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository<TAnalysisData>` for the target persona.
6.  It performs a vector similarity search within the persona's specific Cosmos DB container (`{personaName}KnowledgeContainer`) against the `snippetEmbedding` (or `analysisSummaryEmbedding`, depending on the strategy). See [Database Architecture](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) for container details.
The search likely includes metadata filters (e.g., `userId`, `tags` from related `ArtifactMetadata`).
7.  The repository returns ranked, relevant `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents.
8.  These entries (containing the persona's analysis and the relevant snippet) are used as context for generating a final response via an AI chat client, potentially after fetching the full `ArtifactMetadata` using the `sourceIdentifier` for more context.

## 7. Configuration

*   **Content Extractors:** Configuration might specify preferred extractors or settings for specific MIME types.
*   **AI Providers:** Standard configuration for embedding generators and chat clients (API keys, endpoints, model IDs) via `appsettings.json`, environment variables, or a configuration provider like Azure App Configuration/Aspire.
*   **Database:** Connection strings and database/container names for Cosmos DB.
*   **Storage:** Configuration for accessing the storage mechanism where artifacts and `ArtifactMetadata` reside.
*   **Target Personas:** Configuration defining which personas should process which types of artifacts or based on user context.

## 8. Next Steps

1.  **Implement `IContentExtractor`:** Create initial implementations (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML).
2.  **Implement Synthesizer Processors:** Develop `PlaintextProcessor` (leveraging LLM for Markdown synthesis) and potentially `FileCollectionsProcessor`.
3.  **Implement `IArtifactMetadataService`:** Build the service for managing `ArtifactMetadata`.
4.  **Implement `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository`:** Create the repository for Cosmos DB.
5.  **Develop Orchestration Logic:** Design the pipeline flow (Functions, Service Bus, etc.) incorporating the synthesis step.
6.  **Refactor `IPersona` Interface/Implementations:** Ensure `AnalyzeContentAsync` accepts the synthesized content (Markdown) via an updated `ContentItem` record.
7.  **Implement Reply Event System:** Create message types and subscriptions.
8.  **Implement `IRetrievalService`:** Build the query service.
9.  **Testing:** Implement comprehensive integration tests.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Persona/Vertical Architecture

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-07

This document details the architecture for implementing specialized AI assistants, referred to as "Personas" or "Verticals," within the Nucleus OmniRAG platform, as introduced in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md).

## 1. Core Concept: Personas as Specialized Agents

Personas are distinct, configurable AI agents designed to address specific domains or user needs (e.g., education, business knowledge, personal finance). They encapsulate domain-specific logic, analysis capabilities, and interaction patterns, leveraging the core platform's infrastructure for data ingestion, processing (see [Processing Architecture](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)), storage (see [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)), and retrieval from the [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md).

## 2. The `IPersona` Interface

The foundation of the persona system is the `IPersona` interface (likely defined in `Nucleus.Abstractions` or a dedicated `Nucleus.Personas.Abstractions` project). This interface defines the essential contract for all personas, ensuring they can integrate consistently with the platform.

```csharp
// Example Interface (Subject to refinement)
public interface IPersona<TAnalysisData> where TAnalysisData : class
{
    // Identifier for the persona
    string PersonaId { get; }

    // Display name for the persona
    string DisplayName { get; }

    // Description of the persona's purpose and capabilities
    string Description { get; }

    // Performs persona-specific analysis on the standardized content (e.g., Markdown)
    // provided by the upstream processing pipeline, identifying relevant sections
    // and producing structured analysis results.
    Task<PersonaAnalysisResult<TAnalysisData>> AnalyzeContentAsync(ContentItem content, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    // Handles a user query directed at this persona, leveraging retrieval
    // and AI generation to provide a contextual answer.
    Task<PersonaQueryResult> HandleQueryAsync(UserQuery query, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    // (Optional) Method for persona-specific configuration loading
    Task ConfigureAsync(IConfigurationSection configurationSection);
}

// Supporting types (Examples)
// Represents the input for persona analysis, containing the standardized content.
public record ContentItem(string SourceIdentifier, string StandardizedContent, ArtifactMetadata Metadata, Dictionary<string, object>? AdditionalContext = null);
public record PersonaAnalysisResult<TAnalysisData>(TAnalysisData StructuredAnalysis, string RelevantTextSnippetOrSummary) where TAnalysisData : class;
public record UserQuery(string QueryText, string UserId, Dictionary<string, object> Context);
public record PersonaQueryResult(string ResponseText, List<string> SourceReferences);
```

Key responsibilities defined by `IPersona`:
*   **Identification:** Provide unique ID and descriptive info.
*   **Content Analysis:** Process the **standardized content (e.g., Markdown)** provided by the [Processing Pipeline](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md), identify relevant sections *within that content*, and generate structured insights stored as `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records in the [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md).
*   **Query Handling:** Respond to user queries (originating from [Clients](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md)) within its domain.
*   **Configuration:** Load persona-specific settings.

## 3. Hybrid Project Structure

To promote modularity and separation of concerns, personas are implemented using a hybrid project structure:

*   **`Nucleus.Personas` (Parent Project):**
    *   Contains shared utilities, base classes, or common logic applicable across multiple personas.
    *   May reference `Nucleus.Abstractions` and `Nucleus.Core`.
*   **Individual Persona Projects (e.g., `Nucleus.Personas.EduFlow`, `Nucleus.Personas.BusinessAssistant`):**
    *   Each project implements a specific `IPersona`.
    *   Contains persona-specific models (e.g., `LearningEvidenceAnalysis`), prompts, configuration, and logic.
    *   References the parent `Nucleus.Personas` project and potentially other core/infrastructure projects as needed.

This structure allows new personas to be added relatively independently.

## 4. Initial & Planned Verticals/Personas

Based on the [Project Mandate](./00_PROJECT_MANDATE.md) and existing project structure, the following are initial or planned personas:

### 4.1 Business Knowledge Assistant (Initial Vertical)

*   **Target Deployment:** Self-Hosted Instance (Persistent background processing).
*   **Goal:** Provide a reliable, access-controlled internal Q&A assistant grounded *only* in authorized company information sources.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   Implements `IPersona`.
    *   Primarily focused on the `HandleQueryAsync` aspect, retrieving relevant content from authorized sources based on the user query and potentially user permissions.
    *   Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to synthesize answers based *only* on retrieved content.
    *   Interacts with artifacts ingested via persistent connections configured in the self-hosted environment (SharePoint, configured object storage, etc.).
    *   May involve simpler analysis during ingestion compared to other personas, focusing more on accurate retrieval during query time.
    *   Leverages message queues for asynchronous ingestion and processing triggers.

### 4.2 EduFlow OmniEducator (Initial Vertical)

*   **Target Deployment:** Cloud-Hosted Service (Ephemeral user sessions).
*   **Goal:** Observe, document, and provide insights on authentic learning activities (e.g., analyzing Scratch projects, documents, web browsing related to a project).
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   Implements `IPersona`.
    *   Defines specific analysis schemas (e.g., `LearningEvidenceAnalysis` record) for structuring insights.
    *   Uses AI (via `IChatClient`/Semantic Kernel) with tailored prompts to generate educational observations based on salient content.
    *   Focuses on processing artifacts accessed via ephemeral user tokens (Google Drive, potentially browser extensions).
    *   Analysis results are stored in the backend DB associated with the user's session/temporary identifier.

### 4.3 Other Planned Personas (Likely Cloud-Hosted Targets)

These represent other areas identified for potential persona development, primarily targeting individual users:

*   **HealthSpecialist:** Intended to process personal health data (e.g., fitness tracker logs, health records accessed via user permission) and provide health-related insights or summaries.
*   **PersonalAssistant:** Designed to manage personal tasks, appointments, deadlines, potentially integrating with calendars or task lists via user permission.
*   _(Others like PersonalFinance, WorldModeler could also be considered)_.

## 5. Interaction with Platform Services

Personas are clients of the core platform services, accessing them via dependency injection. The primary interaction patterns are:

*   **Content Analysis (`AnalyzeContentAsync`):** For analyzing new content, personas **receive the standardized content (e.g., Markdown) within the `ContentItem` directly from the processing pipeline**. They do not need to fetch the content themselves for this initial analysis step.
*   **Query Handling (`HandleQueryAsync`):** When responding to user queries, personas may need to access additional information. This involves:
    *   **Retrieval Service (`IRetrievalService` - Name TBC):** Querying the vector database (Knowledge DB) for relevant `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records based on the user query.
    *   **Storage (`IFileStorage`) / Source APIs:** In some cases, if the retrieved context is insufficient or the persona needs to verify information against the original source, it *might* interact directly with `IFileStorage` or platform-specific APIs (like Microsoft Graph) to access original artifact content, **always respecting user permissions and context**. This is considered a secondary access pattern during querying.
*   **Database (`IRepository<T>`):** Reading/writing persona-specific analysis results (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`), potentially accessing configuration or shared context.
*   **AI Client (`IChatClient`, `IEmbeddingGenerator` from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`):** Interacting with LLMs for analysis generation, query answering, and potentially function calling. Note: `IEmbeddingGenerator` is used by the *pipeline*, not typically directly by the persona during analysis.
*   **Message Queue (Publisher/Subscriber):** Potentially publishing events (e.g., `AnalysisComplete`) or subscribing to relevant platform events (e.g., `NewContentAvailable`) - more common in self-hosted or complex workflow scenarios.

_Note: While personas analyze **standardized content** to identify relevant sections, they do NOT directly generate embeddings - this is the responsibility of the Processing Pipeline after receiving the persona's analysis results._

## 6. Persona-Specific Analysis Schemas

A key aspect is the ability for personas to generate structured analysis outputs.

*   **C# Records:** Define specific C# record types within the persona's project (e.g., `Nucleus.Personas.EduFlow.Models.LearningEvidenceAnalysis`).
*   **Semantic Kernel / Function Calling:** Leverage Semantic Kernel and LLM function calling (or JSON mode) to instruct the AI model to generate outputs conforming to the JSON schema derived from these records (as outlined in Memory `b62d4c46`).
*   **Implementation:** Personas use `IChatClient` from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` (not a custom `IAiClient` abstraction) for LLM interactions, potentially wrapped in Semantic Kernel for structured output generation.
*   **Persistence:** These structured results are stored alongside the relevant text snippet in the database, allowing for targeted querying and aggregation later.

## 7. Configuration

Persona behavior can be configured via standard .NET mechanisms (`appsettings.json`, environment variables, Aspire configuration):

*   Persona-specific API keys or endpoints (if using unique external services).
*   Prompts and templates.
*   Feature flags or behavior toggles.
*   Thresholds (e.g., salience scores).

The `IPersona.ConfigureAsync` method provides a hook for personas to load their specific configuration sections.

## 8. Next Steps

1.  **Refine `IPersona` Interface:** Update the interface to standardize on `AnalyzeContentAsync` for content processing, ensuring it accepts **standardized content (e.g., Markdown via `ContentItem.StandardizedContent`)** and returns both structured analysis and identified relevant text.
2.  **Create Project Structure:** Set up the `Nucleus.Personas` parent project and initial `Nucleus.Personas.EduFlow` and `Nucleus.Personas.BusinessAssistant` projects. (Partially done, needs BusinessAssistant project).
3.  **Implement Base Logic:** Create base classes or shared utilities in `Nucleus.Personas` if needed.
4.  **Refactor EduFlow Implementation:** Update to use `IChatClient` from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` (replacing `IAiClient`), implement the refined interface, and ensure it works directly with **standardized content**.
5.  **Develop Business Assistant:** Implement initial query handling logic using `IRetrievalService` and basic RAG.
6.  **DI Registration:** Ensure personas are discoverable and registered correctly in the application's DI container.
7.  **Integration Tests:** Test persona interaction with core services (mocked and potentially integrated).

---

_This architecture document provides the blueprint for personas, emphasizing their role in directly analyzing **standardized content**, identifying relevant sections, and generating structured insights without relying on generic pre-chunking or direct handling of diverse raw formats._

### Key Services and Abstractions

*   **`IArtifactMetadataService`**: Manages CRUD operations for `ArtifactMetadata` in the central Storage repository.
*   **`IContentExtractor`**: Interface for services that extract raw text/structured content from various artifact MIME types (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.). Implementations handle specific formats.
*   **`IPersona`**: The core interface defining a persona's analytical capabilities, primarily through `AnalyzeContentAsync`.
*   **`IChatClient` (from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`)**: The standard abstraction for interacting with LLMs for chat completions. Implementations will handle provider-specific details, including context caching integration.
*   **`IEmbeddingGenerator` (from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`)**: The standard abstraction for generating text embeddings.
*   **`IPersonaKnowledgeRepository`**: Interface for services managing the storage and retrieval of `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents in the persona-specific data stores (Cosmos DB).
*   **`ICacheManagementService` (Planned for Phase 2+ - see [Phase 2 Requirements](../Requirements/02_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE2_MULTI_PLATFORM.md))**: Abstraction responsible for interacting with the underlying AI provider's prompt/context caching mechanisms. It handles creating, retrieving, and potentially managing the lifecycle (TTL) of cached content linked to a `SourceIdentifier`.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Storage Architecture

**Version:** 1.6
**Date:** 2025-04-13

This document outlines the architecture for managing **artifacts** and their associated **metadata** within the Nucleus OmniRAG system, expanding on the concepts introduced in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). A fundamental principle is that Nucleus **does not maintain its own persistent artifact storage**. Instead, it interacts with artifacts directly within the user's chosen source systems (e.g., Microsoft Teams/SharePoint, Slack, Email Servers) via platform-specific adapters (see [Client Architecture](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md)), respecting existing permissions (see [Security Architecture](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md)). Nucleus's own persistent storage ([Cosmos DB](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md)) is reserved exclusively for **metadata** (`ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) derived from or describing these external artifacts.

## 1. Core Principles

*   **User Source System is Authoritative:** The original artifact (user-provided *or* Nucleus-generated) resides and is managed within the user's designated source system (SharePoint, Slack Files, Google Drive, etc.). Nucleus interacts with these systems via [adapters](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md).
*   **Metadata in Nucleus DB:** Essential metadata about the source artifact (`ArtifactMetadata`) and persona-specific analysis (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) are stored in Nucleus's own [database layer (Cosmos DB)](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md). This metadata contains pointers (`sourceUri`) to the actual artifact in the user's system.
*   **No Intermediate Storage:** Nucleus avoids creating its own persistent store for artifacts. Temporary, in-memory streams or extremely short-lived local caches might be used during [processing](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md), but **no intermediate persistence** (like Azure Blob Storage or dedicated file shares) should be relied upon, aligning with Memory `08b60bec`.
*   **Permission-Based Access:** Nucleus accesses artifacts in the source system using the permissions granted to its corresponding bot or application identity within that platform (e.g., Teams bot permissions to read/write files in a channel). See [Security Architecture](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md).
*   **Support Diverse Sources:** The architecture must accommodate artifacts from various locations accessible via APIs (cloud drives, collaboration platforms, email attachments) through the [Client/Adapter Architecture](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md).

## 2. Key Metadata Structure: `ArtifactMetadata`

The `ArtifactMetadata` record is the central object persisted in the `ArtifactMetadataContainer` within [Cosmos DB](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) for *every* unique artifact Nucleus interacts with. It represents Nucleus's understanding of the artifact's properties and context, derived primarily from the source system via [Adapters](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md).

**Conceptual Fields (Illustrative - Not Exhaustive):**

*   **Identification & Core:**
    *   `id`: (string) Unique Cosmos DB document ID. *Primary Key.*
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: (string) A stable, unique logical identifier *within Nucleus* for this artifact (e.g., `spo://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/TeamSite/Shared%20Documents/Report.docx?ver=1`, `msteams://channel/19:xxx@thread.tacv2/messageid/12345`, `slack://ws/T123/C456/p1678886400.123456`). *Logically Unique Key, Indexed.*
    *   `sourceUri`: (string) The direct URI or locator used by the Platform Adapter to access the artifact content in the source system.

    *   `threadSourceIdentifier`: (string | null) `sourceIdentifier` of the root message of the conversation thread this artifact belongs to.
    *   `referencedSourceIdentifiers`: (List<string> | null) `sourceIdentifier`s of other artifacts explicitly mentioned or linked within this one (e.g., linked files, @mentioned artifacts).
    *   `compositeArtifactId`: (string | null) Identifier if this artifact is part of a larger logical unit (e.g., a multi-part email, a slide in a presentation represented individually).
    *   `originatingContext`: (object | null) Additional source-specific context (e.g., `{ "channelId": "19:xxx@thread.tacv2", "teamId": "uuid" }` for Teams).

*   **Authorship & Ownership (`Who`):**
    *   `sourceCreatedByUserId`: (string | null) Identifier of the user who created the artifact in the source system.
    *   `sourceLastModifiedByUserId`: (string | null) Identifier of the user who last modified it in the source system.
    *   `ownerUserId`: (string | null) Identifier of the user considered the 'owner' within Nucleus context (might align with `sourceCreatedByUserId` or be assigned).

*   **Timestamps (`When`):**
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`: (DateTimeOffset | null) Timestamp from the source system.
    *   `sourceLastModifiedAt`: (DateTimeOffset | null) Timestamp from the source system.
    *   `timestampIngested`: (DateTimeOffset) When Nucleus first created this metadata record.
    *   `timestampLastProcessed`: (DateTimeOffset | null) When any persona last successfully processed this artifact.
    *   `timestampLastAccessed`: (DateTimeOffset | null) When the content was last fetched via an adapter (optional, for cache/staleness checks).

    *   `potentialPurposeTags`: (List<string> | null) Inferred tags about the artifact's likely purpose (e.g., 'report', 'meeting_notes', 'user_query').

*   **Generation Info (`How` Part 2 - For Nucleus-Generated Artifacts):**
    *   `generationMethod`: (string | null) e.g., `persona_generated`, `system_process`.
    *   `generatingPersonaName`: (string | null) If `generationMethod` is `persona_generated`, the name of the persona (e.g., `ProfessionalColleague_v1`).
    *   `originatingSourceIdentifier`: (string | null) The `sourceIdentifier` of the artifact (e.g., user message) that triggered the generation of this artifact.

*   **Processing State:**
    *   `overallProcessingState`: (string enum) e.g., `Pending`, `Processing`, `Processed`, `Failed`, `Skipped`.
    *   `personaProcessingStatus`: (Dictionary<string, PersonaProcessingState>) Tracks the status per target persona (e.g., `{"EduFlow_v1": {"state": "Processed", "timestamp": "...", "pkeId": "guid"}, "Health_v2": {"state": "Pending"}}`). Includes status, timestamp, errors, and optionally the ID of the generated `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`.

*   **Access Control:**
    *   `accessControlList`: (List<ACLEntry> | null) Denormalized list of users/groups and their permissions derived from the source system (can be complex).
    *   `sensitivityLabel`: (string | null) e.g., 'Confidential', 'Public' (from source system).

**(Note:** The exact fields, types, and nullability will be refined during C# model implementation and depend on Adapter capabilities.)

## 3. Handling Persona-Generated Artifacts

A core principle is that Nucleus **does not manage its own persistent artifact storage layer**. This applies equally to artifacts generated *by* Personas (e.g., reports, summaries, code, data visualizations) in response to user requests.

1.  **Generation:** A Persona generates the content for a new artifact.
2.  **Storage via Adapters:** The Nucleus Processing Pipeline takes the generated content and uses the appropriate **Platform Adapter** (e.g., `SharePointAdapter`, `MSTeamsAdapter`) to save this content *back into the user's designated source system* (e.g., a specific SharePoint library, the Files tab of a Teams channel, a user's OneDrive).
3.  **Metadata Creation:** Upon successful saving, the Adapter returns the necessary details (like the `sourceUri`, `displayName`, `sizeBytes`, etc.) of the newly created artifact in the source system.
4.  **`ArtifactMetadata` Record:** Nucleus creates a standard `ArtifactMetadata` record for this newly generated artifact in the `ArtifactMetadataContainer`.
5.  **Linking Generation Context:** This new record's `ArtifactMetadata` is populated with:
    *   `sourceSystemType`: The target system (e.g., `SharePoint`).
    *   `sourceUri`: The URI where the generated artifact now resides.
    *   `generationMethod`: Set to `persona_generated`.
    *   `generatingPersonaName`: The name of the persona that produced the content.
    *   `originatingSourceIdentifier`: The `sourceIdentifier` of the user's request or context that led to this generation.

This approach ensures:
*   User data (including generated artifacts) remains within their managed environment.
*   Generated artifacts are discoverable and manageable using the source system's native tools.
*   Nucleus maintains a consistent metadata view across ingested and generated artifacts.

## 4. Core Operations

*   **Ingestion/Update:** When a new artifact is detected or an existing one changes in a source system:
    *   The corresponding Adapter notifies the Processing Pipeline.
    *   The Processing Pipeline updates the `ArtifactMetadata` record in Cosmos DB.
    *   The Processing Pipeline triggers the appropriate Personas for analysis.

*   **Persona Analysis:** Personas analyze the artifact content (fetched via Adapters) and generate `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data.
    *   The `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data is stored in Cosmos DB.
    *   The `ArtifactMetadata` record is updated with the analysis results.

*   **Query Handling:** When a user submits a query:
    *   The Query Handler retrieves relevant `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records from Cosmos DB.
    *   The Query Handler uses the retrieved data to generate a response.

## 5. Integration with Other Architectures

*   **Processing Pipeline (`01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md`):**
    *   Receives triggers (e.g., webhook from Teams) indicating a new/updated artifact in the source system.
    *   Creates or updates the `ArtifactMetadata` document in Cosmos DB.
    *   Uses platform adapters to fetch the artifact content stream from the `sourceUri` for analysis.
    *   Updates processing status fields in the `ArtifactMetadata` document.
*   **Database Layer (`04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md`):**
    *   Is the primary persistence layer for `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`.
    *   Leverages Cosmos DB features for indexing (including vector indexing on embeddings within `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`), querying, and scaling.
*   **Persona Layer (`02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md`):**
    *   Receives artifact content streams (fetched by the pipeline) for analysis.
    *   Produces `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data (including analysis and embeddings) stored in Cosmos DB.
    *   During query handling, retrieves relevant `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents from Cosmos DB. May use the associated `sourceIdentifier` to request the pipeline/adapter layer to fetch fresh snippets or verify information from the original artifact via its `sourceUri` if needed.
*   **Client/Adapter Layer (`05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`):**
    *   Provides the concrete implementations for interacting with source systems (Graph API, Slack API, etc.) to read/write artifacts using appropriate authentication and permissions.
    *   Handles triggers/webhooks from source systems.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Nucleus adapters must securely authenticate with source systems (e.g., OAuth for Graph API, Slack Bot Tokens). Access to artifacts is governed by the permissions granted to the Nucleus application/bot identity *within the source system*.
*   **Data Minimization:** Nucleus only stores metadata in its database. The potentially sensitive content remains within the user's controlled environment.
*   **Cosmos DB Security:** Standard database security practices apply (network restrictions, access keys/RBAC, encryption at rest/transit).
*   **Secrets Management:** Securely manage API keys, OAuth client secrets, bot tokens needed by adapters (e.g., Azure Key Vault, Aspire configuration).
*   **PII/Sensitive Data:** While original content stays external, the metadata itself (`displayName`, `tags`, user IDs, context) might contain PII. Apply appropriate data handling policies.

## 7. Composite Artifact Handling

When a source artifact represents a collection (e.g., a folder, an email with multiple attachments), the `ArtifactMetadata` system uses the optional `composite...` fields in Cosmos DB to link them:

1.  A **parent** `ArtifactMetadata` document can be created for the container concept (e.g., the folder, the email itself), assigned a unique `compositeArtifactId`, and role `Parent`.
2.  **Child** `ArtifactMetadata` documents are created for each item within the container (files in folder, attachments), inheriting the same `compositeArtifactId`, linking back via `parentSourceIdentifier`, and assigned role `Child`.
3.  This allows personas, when analyzing a child artifact, to query Cosmos DB using the `compositeArtifactId` to retrieve metadata for related items, understanding the full context.

## 8. Next Steps

1.  **Implement `IArtifactMetadataRepository`:** Create a repository interface and Cosmos DB implementation for CRUD operations on `ArtifactMetadata` documents.
2.  **Finalize `sourceIdentifier` Strategy:** Define the precise algorithm for generating stable logical `sourceIdentifier`s for different `SourceSystemType`s, ensuring uniqueness and allowing correlation even if the `sourceUri` changes slightly (e.g., SharePoint version updates).
3.  **Integrate with Processing Pipeline:** Ensure the pipeline correctly interacts with the `IArtifactMetadataRepository` and uses platform adapters to fetch content via `sourceUri`.
4.  **Develop Platform Adapters:** Build out the necessary adapters in the Client Layer (`05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`) for key target source systems.
5.  **Refine Metadata Schema:** Continuously refine the `ArtifactMetadata` fields based on persona needs and extraction capabilities.

_This architecture clarifies that Nucleus leverages user source systems for artifact storage via adapters and uses its own database (Cosmos DB) solely for persisting rich metadata (`ArtifactMetadata`) and derived persona knowledge._

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Database Architecture (Azure Cosmos DB)

**Version:** 1.8
**Date:** 2025-04-13

This document details the architecture of the backend database used by Nucleus OmniRAG, utilizing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, as introduced in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). Cosmos DB serves as the central persistence layer for **all** Nucleus-managed metadata, including both the primary **`ArtifactMetadata`** records describing source artifacts (see [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)) and the **`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`** records containing persona-specific analysis (see [Persona Architecture](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md)).

## 1. Core Principle: Centralized Metadata in Cosmos DB

Cosmos DB's role is to provide a highly performant, scalable store for all structured metadata Nucleus generates and manages.

*   **`ArtifactMetadata` Store:** Holds the central, factual records *about* each source artifact encountered (defined in [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)).
*   **`PersonaKnowledgeEntry` Stores:** Holds the *interpretations* and analyses of artifacts generated by specific [Personas](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md).

This approach keeps all queryable metadata within a single, manageable database system, while the actual artifact content remains in the user's source system (accessed via [Adapters/Clients](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md)).

## 2. Database Structure

The Cosmos DB database contains multiple containers:

*   **`ArtifactMetadataContainer` (Recommended Name):**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores all `ArtifactMetadata` documents.
    *   **Partition Key:** Likely `tenantId` (for multi-tenant/self-hosted) or potentially `userId` if strictly single-user focus, or even a synthetic key depending on query patterns across users/tenants.
*   **`{PersonaId}KnowledgeContainer` (One per Persona):**
    *   **Naming Convention:** e.g., `EduFlow_v1KnowledgeContainer`, `BusinessAssistant_v1KnowledgeContainer`.
    *   **Purpose:** Each container holds all `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents generated by that specific persona.
    *   **Partition Key:** Typically `userId` (for Cloud-Hosted, user-scoped queries) or `tenantId` (for Self-Hosted, tenant-scoped queries).

## 3. `ArtifactMetadataContainer` Schema

Documents in this container follow the `ArtifactMetadata` structure defined in `03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md` (which describes the logical model persisted here). It serves as the single source of truth *within Nucleus* about an artifact.

*   **Key Fields:** `id` (Cosmos Document ID), `sourceIdentifier` (logical key), `sourceUri`, `sourceSystemType`, `displayName`, timestamps, authorship, relationships, processing status (`overallProcessingState`, `personaProcessingStatus`), etc.

## 4. `{PersonaId}KnowledgeContainer` Schema

Each document stored within a persona-specific container follows the `PersonaKnowledgeEntry<TAnalysisData>` structure, representing that persona's interpretation of a source artifact.

*   **Document Example (`EduFlow_v1KnowledgeContainer` storing `PersonaKnowledgeEntry<EduFlowAnalysis>`):
    ```json
    {
        "id": "unique-pke-guid", // Cosmos DB Document ID for this PersonaKnowledgeEntry
        "userId": "user-guid-or-identifier",     // Partition Key (Cloud-Hosted)
        // "tenantId": "tenant-guid-or-identifier", // Partition Key Alt (Self-Hosted)
        "sourceIdentifier": "spo://...Q1_Report.docx?ver=1", // Links to the ArtifactMetadata document (matches its sourceIdentifier)
        "sourceSegmentIdentifier": null, // Optional: Identifier for a sub-part of the source artifact
        "personaName": "EduFlow_v1", // Explicitly states the generating persona
        "relevantTextSnippetOrSummary": "EduFlow decided this text was most relevant: Learner shows understanding of algebraic equations...", // Persona-extracted/generated text snippet or summary, max length enforced!
        "snippetEmbedding": [0.12, -0.05, ...], // Vector embedding of relevantTextSnippetOrSummary
        "analysis": { // Persona-specific structured analysis object (TAnalysisData)
            // Example for EduFlowAnalysis:
            "analysisTimestamp": "2025-04-08T03:00:00Z",
            "modelVersion": "gemini-1.5-pro-latest",
            "confidenceLevel": "High",
            "summary": "Learner demonstrates proficiency in solving linear equations but struggles with quadratic formulas.",
            "suggestedSkillIds": ["skill-algebra-linear", "skill-problem-solving"],
            "potentialMisconceptions": "Confuses quadratic formula terms."
            // ... other EduFlowAnalysis specific fields
        },
        // Optional: Embedding of a derived summary from the analysis object itself
        // "analysisSummaryEmbedding": [-0.08, 0.25, ...],
        "relatedSourceIdentifiers": ["spo://.../Q1_Data.xlsx?ver=3"], // Links to other ArtifactMetadata suggested by the persona
        "timestampCreated": "2025-04-08T03:05:00Z", // When this PKE was created
        "timestampLastUpdated": "2025-04-08T03:05:00Z", // When this PKE was last updated
        "_ts": 1678722600 // Cosmos DB Timestamp
    }
    ```

### 4.1 C# Model: `PersonaKnowledgeEntry<TAnalysisData>`

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

/// <summary>
/// Enum representing the confidence level of the persona's analysis.
/// </summary>
public enum ConfidenceLevel
{
    Unknown = 0,
    VeryLow = 1,
    Low = 2,
    Medium = 3,
    High = 4,
    VeryHigh = 5
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents a specific piece of knowledge or analysis generated by a Persona,
/// linked to a specific source artifact or segment. This captures what a persona knows about that source/segment.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="TAnalysisData">The CLR type of the persona-specific analysis payload.</typeparam>
public record PersonaKnowledgeEntry<TAnalysisData>(
    [property: JsonPropertyName("id")] string id, // Primary Key (Document ID)
    string userId, // Typically used as Partition Key (Cloud-Hosted)
    string sourceIdentifier, // Foreign Key linking to the ArtifactMetadata document (matches its sourceIdentifier)
    string? sourceSegmentIdentifier, // Optional: Identifier for a sub-part of the source artifact
    string personaName, // Name/Version of the persona that generated this entry
    string relevantTextSnippetOrSummary, // The specific text snippet/summary identified by the persona
    Embedding<float> snippetEmbedding, // Vector embedding of the relevantTextSnippetOrSummary
    TAnalysisData analysis, // The structured analysis payload specific to the persona (must include ConfidenceLevel)
    Embedding<float>? analysisSummaryEmbedding, // Optional: Embedding of a derived summary from the analysis
    List<string>? relatedSourceIdentifiers, // Optional: Links to other related ArtifactMetadata records
    DateTimeOffset timestampCreated,
    DateTimeOffset timestampLastUpdated,
    string? tenantId // Optional: Partition Key alternative (Self-Hosted)
)
{
    // Explicit property for Cosmos SDK partition key path mapping if needed
    // Adjust logic based on hosting model
    [JsonIgnore]
    public string PartitionKey => tenantId ?? userId;
}

## 5. Integration with Other Architectures

### 5.1 Processing (`01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md`)
*   The pipeline interacts primarily with Cosmos DB and Platform [Adapters](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md):
    *   Receives trigger with source artifact info (e.g., `sourceUri`).
    *   Creates/Updates the `ArtifactMetadata` document in the `ArtifactMetadataContainer` in Cosmos DB.
    *   Uses Platform [Adapters](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md) (see `05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md`) to fetch artifact content from the `sourceUri`.
    *   Extracts raw text.
    *   For each target persona:
        *   Invokes the persona's analysis logic (`AnalyzeContentAsync`).
        *   Persona generates `analysis` (type `TAnalysisData`) and `relevantTextSnippetOrSummary`.
        *   Pipeline calculates `snippetEmbedding` (and optionally `analysisSummaryEmbedding`).
        *   Pipeline writes the complete `PersonaKnowledgeEntry<TAnalysisData>` record to the specific `{PersonaId}KnowledgeContainer` in Cosmos DB.
        *   Pipeline updates the `personaProcessingStatus` dictionary within the relevant `ArtifactMetadata` document in Cosmos DB.

### 5.2 Personas (`02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md`)

*   **Analysis:** Personas receive artifact content streams, perform analysis, and return the `analysis` object and `relevantTextSnippetOrSummary` to the pipeline.
*   **Retrieval for Querying/Reporting (RAG):**
    *   A persona queries **its own** `{PersonaId}KnowledgeContainer` in Cosmos DB.
    *   It performs vector searches against `snippetEmbedding` or `analysisSummaryEmbedding`.
    *   Field projection retrieves necessary fields (`id`, `relevantTextSnippetOrSummary`, `analysis`, `sourceIdentifier`, etc.).
    *   If needed, the persona can use the `sourceIdentifier` from a retrieved PKE to request the full `ArtifactMetadata` (from `ArtifactMetadataContainer`) or even fresh content from the source system via adapters (using `sourceUri`) for more context.

### 5.3 Storage (`03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md`)

*   The [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md) document (`03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md`) primarily defines the **logical structure of the `ArtifactMetadata` object**, which is persisted within the `ArtifactMetadataContainer` in Cosmos DB.
*   It clarifies that artifact *content* resides externally in user source systems, accessed via [Adapters](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md).

## 6. Scalability and Performance

*   **Partitioning:** Proper partition key selection (`userId`, `tenantId`, or other) is crucial for distributing load and enabling efficient queries within both `ArtifactMetadataContainer` and `{PersonaId}KnowledgeContainer`s. The choice impacts cost and scalability and is influenced by the [Deployment Model](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) (e.g., cloud-hosted multi-tenant vs. self-hosted single-tenant) and [Security](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md) requirements.
*   **Vector Search:** Integrated Vector Database capabilities in Cosmos DB enable efficient similarity searches within each persona's container.
*   **Indexing:** Appropriate indexing policies (beyond vector indexes) are needed for efficient metadata filtering (see [Security considerations](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md) regarding what gets indexed).
*   **Throughput:** RU/s need to be provisioned appropriately for the database or individual containers based on expected load (see [Deployment Architecture](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for cost implications).

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Implement C# Models:** Finalize `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry<T>` records, enums, and concrete `TAnalysisData` types for each persona.
2.  **Implement Repository Layer:** Develop data access repositories (`IArtifactMetadataRepository`, `IPersonaKnowledgeRepository<TAnalysisData>`) using the Cosmos DB .NET SDK. Ensure dynamic container handling for PKEs.
3.  **Define Partition Key Strategy:** Finalize the partition key choices for both container types based on [deployment models](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) and query patterns.
4.  **Provision Cosmos DB:** Set up the Cosmos DB account, database, and define container creation/configuration strategy (part of [Deployment](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)).
5.  **Integrate with Processing Pipeline:** Update the [pipeline](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md) to implement the flow described in Section 5.1.

_This architecture document specifies the Cosmos DB structure, clarifying its role as the central store for both factual `ArtifactMetadata` and interpretive `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data, linking them via the `sourceIdentifier`._

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Client Architecture

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2025-04-11

This document outlines the architecture for client applications interacting with the Nucleus OmniRAG backend API, as introduced in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). It details the primary interaction mechanism for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – a command-line interface (CLI) application – and outlines future plans for integrating with collaboration platforms.

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Direct API Interaction:** Clients primarily interact with the backend via the defined `Nucleus.Api` endpoints (see [Deployment Architecture](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)).
*   **Clear Feedback:** Provide clear status updates and output to the user for all operations.
*   **Extensibility:** The core API design should support various client types.
*   **Development Focus (MVP):** The initial client prioritizes enabling rapid development, testing, and direct interaction for developers and agents.

## 2. MVP Client: Nucleus Console Application (`Nucleus.Console`)

The primary client interface for the Nucleus OmniRAG MVP is a .NET Console Application. This approach provides a direct, scriptable, and efficient way to interact with the backend API, facilitating development, testing, and agent-driven operations.

**Key Goals:**
*   Provide a command-line interface for core Nucleus operations ([ingestion](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md), [querying](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md), [status checks](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)).
*   Act as a direct client to the [`Nucleus.Api`](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md).
*   Display responses and status information clearly in the terminal.
*   Serve as the initial integration point for developers and AI assistants working on the project.

**Technology Stack:**
*   **.NET 9 Console Application:** The core project type.
*   **`System.CommandLine`:** For robust command parsing, argument handling, and help generation.
*   **`Microsoft.Extensions.Http` (`IHttpClientFactory`):** For making resilient HTTP requests to the `Nucleus.Api`.
*   **`Spectre.Console` (Optional but Recommended):** For richer terminal output (tables, spinners, formatted text).
*   **`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`:** For managing dependencies like `HttpClient`.

**Interaction Pattern:**
1.  User invokes `Nucleus.Console` with a command and arguments (e.g., `nucleus ingest ./myfile.pdf`).
2.  `System.CommandLine` parses the input.
3.  The corresponding command handler is executed.
4.  The handler uses `HttpClient` (obtained via `IHttpClientFactory`) to make one or more calls to the `Nucleus.Api`.
5.  The handler receives the API response (e.g., JSON data, status codes).
6.  The handler formats and displays the results to the console (potentially using `Spectre.Console`).

**Example Command Structure (Conceptual):**

```bash
# Ingest a local file
nucleus ingest --path "./docs/my_document.pdf" [--persona GeneralAnalyst]

# Ingest content from a URI
nucleus ingest --uri "https://example.com/article.html"

# Query a specific persona
nucleus query --persona FinanceExpert "Summarize the Q1 financial report highlights."

# List available personas
nucleus personas list

# Check status of processing artifacts
nucleus status list [--status Processing]

# Get details for a specific artifact
nucleus status get --id <artifact-guid>
```

**Displaying Output:**
*   **Success:** Display relevant information from the API response (e.g., artifact ID after ingestion, query response text). Use clear formatting (potentially tables for lists).
*   **Progress:** For long-running operations initiated via the console (if any), use spinners or progress indicators (`Spectre.Console`).
*   **Errors:** Display clear error messages based on API status codes or exception details. Include correlation IDs if available.

## 3. Future Clients: Platform Integration (Phase 2+)

While the Console App serves the MVP, the long-term vision involves integrating Nucleus OmniRAG directly into users' existing workflows via platform-specific bots and adapters.

**Goals:**
*   Bring [persona](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) interaction directly into Teams, Slack, Discord, Email, etc.
*   Leverage platform UI, notifications, and file sharing.
*   Enable natural language interaction with personas.

**Components (Planned for Phase 2+):**
*   **Platform Adapters (`Nucleus.Adapters.*`):** Implementations specific to each platform (Teams, Slack, Email) responsible for:
    *   Receiving messages/events.
    *   Translating them into Nucleus [API](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) calls or messages.
    *   Handling platform [authentication](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md) and user mapping.
    *   Formatting and sending responses back to the platform.
*   **Common Adapter Interface (`IPlatformAdapter`):** A standard interface for adapters, defined in [Adapter Interfaces](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md).
*   **API Enhancements:** Potential additions to the [API](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) to better support bot-specific needs (e.g., managing conversation state).

**Technology Stack (Potential):**
*   Microsoft Bot Framework SDK
*   Slack Bolt / Slack APIs
*   Discord.NET / Discord APIs
*   MailKit / Azure Communication Services / Graph API (for Email)

## 4. Key Considerations

*   **API Contract:** The [`Nucleus.Api`](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) serves as the stable contract for all clients. Changes must be managed carefully.
*   **Authentication:** The Console App might initially rely on simple API keys or local development bypasses. Production scenarios (including future bots) will require robust [authentication](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md) (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
*   **Configuration:** The Console App will need a mechanism (e.g., `appsettings.json`, environment variables) to know the `Nucleus.Api` base URL.

## 5. Common Adapter Patterns & Responsibilities (Phase 2+)

While implementations will vary based on the target platform, adapters should generally adhere to the following patterns and responsibilities defined in the [Adapter Interfaces document](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md):

*   **Initialization & Configuration:** Load necessary platform SDKs, authenticate with the platform (see [Security](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md)), and retrieve Nucleus [API](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) endpoint/authentication details.
*   **User/Tenant Mapping:** Establish a reliable mapping between platform user/team identifiers and Nucleus user/tenant contexts (relevant to [Security](./06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md)).
*   **Event Handling:** Listen for relevant platform events (e.g., new messages, file uploads, commands).
*   **Command Parsing:** Interpret user commands or specific interaction triggers (e.g., @mentions).
*   **API Interaction:** Translate platform events and user commands into appropriate [`Nucleus.Api`](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) calls.
    *   **Ingestion:** Trigger artifact [ingestion](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md) via the API, potentially uploading content directly or providing URLs.
    *   **Querying:** Send user queries to the relevant [persona](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) endpoints.
    *   **Status Checks:** Allow users to query the status of ongoing [processing](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md).
*   **Response Formatting:** Format Nucleus API responses into platform-native messages (e.g., Teams Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, plain text).
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide clear feedback to the user about command acceptance, processing status, and final results.
*   **Artifact Handling:** Manage the upload/download of artifacts between the platform storage (e.g., SharePoint, Slack files) and the Nucleus backend, respecting the defined [storage architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md) for the platform (see specific adapter documents like [Console](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_CONSOLE.md) and [Teams](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS.md)).
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle platform-specific errors and Nucleus API errors, providing informative messages to the user.
*   **Administrative Capabilities:** Future adapters will also need to surface administrative functionalities (monitoring, user management, persona configuration, reporting) as defined in [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#33-enterprise-readiness--admin-features) (REQ-P4-ADM-001 to ADM-004). This might involve dedicated admin commands or interfaces within the client platform (e.g., specific Adaptive Cards in Teams for authorized administrators).

## 6. Next Steps

1.  **Initialize `Nucleus.Console` Project:** Set up the basic project structure with required NuGet packages (`System.CommandLine`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Http`).
2.  **Configure `HttpClient`:** Use `IServiceCollection` and `IHttpClientFactory` to configure the client for accessing the [`Nucleus.Api`](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) (base address, default headers if needed).
3.  **Implement Initial Commands:** Start with basic commands:
    *   `nucleus status ping`: A simple command to verify API connectivity.
    *   `nucleus ingest --path <filepath>`: Implement the file [ingestion](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md) workflow.
    *   `nucleus query --persona <name> "<prompt>"`: Implement the basic [query](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) workflow.
4.  **Define API DTOs:** Ensure necessary Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) shared between the API and Console client are defined (likely in `Nucleus.Abstractions`).
5.  **Develop Command Handlers:** Write the logic within the console app to parse arguments, call the API, and display results.
6.  **(Ongoing)** Refine command structure and output formatting as API capabilities expand.

Security and responsible data governance are paramount for the Nucleus OmniRAG platform, especially given its interaction with potentially sensitive user information and its deployment in both individual (Cloud-Hosted) and team/organizational (Self-Hosted) contexts, as outlined in the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). This document outlines the core security principles, data boundaries, authentication/authorization strategies, and responsibilities.

## 2. Data Governance & Boundaries

Nucleus is designed to process user data, not to be its primary custodian.

*   **Primary Data Source:** Original user files (documents, images, etc.) **always reside in the user's designated cloud storage** (e.g., Personal OneDrive/GDrive for Individuals, Team SharePoint/Shared Drives for Teams - see [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)). Nucleus interacts with these sources via API, respecting the permissions granted by the user/organization.
*   **Nucleus ArtifactMetadata:**
    *   Stored within the **Nucleus [Database (Cosmos DB)](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md)**.
    *   Contain metadata *about* the source file (identifiers, hashes, timestamps, content type, [processing](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md) status, originating context, etc.).
    *   **Policy:** ArtifactMetadata should avoid storing sensitive PII directly from the source document. Fields like `displayName` are acceptable.
*   **Nucleus Database (Cosmos DB):**
    *   Stores [`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) documents.
    *   Contains: **Derived knowledge, salient text snippets, and vector embeddings** (derived data), [persona-specific](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) analysis (`TAnalysisData`), `sourceIdentifier` linking back to the ArtifactMetadata, timestamps.
    *   **PII Consideration:** Text previews or `TAnalysisData` fields *might* contain sensitive information derived from the source. [Personas](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) generating this data should be designed with potential sensitivity in mind. Redaction/scrubbing strategies are persona-specific implementation details.
*   **Chat Logs:**
    *   Inbound chat messages are inspected for salience and may be processed by Nucleus components ([Functions/Workers](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)) to generate responses.
    *   Salient portions of chat may be bundled into an artifact and placed into the user's long-term storage as an artifact that could be later retrieved for specifics.
    *   The Nucleus backend **does not persist raw chat conversation logs**.
*   **Data Flow:** Data fetched from user [storage](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md) is processed transiently by Nucleus components ([Processing Architecture](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)). Only derived metadata, embeddings, previews, and analysis are persisted in the Nucleus [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md). Original content is not duplicated or stored by Nucleus; while Self-Hosted [deployments](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) might integrate external organizational caching, the core Nucleus system remains ephemeral regarding source content.

```

**Explanation:** This diagram illustrates the core security boundaries and data flow:
*   The **User's Domain** holds the original sensitive artifacts in their designated cloud storage.
*   The **Nucleus Domain** contains the application components:
    *   [Adapters/API](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md) handle user interaction and external requests.
    *   Transient [Processing Services](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md) handle sensitive data ephemerally during analysis.
    *   [Persona Modules](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) perform specialized analysis.
    *   The [Database (Cosmos DB)](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) stores only derived metadata and knowledge.
    *   Key Vault secures credentials.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Adapters authenticate with Key Vault and interact with external storage APIs using OAuth tokens.
    *   Data flows ephemerally through processing and persona layers.
    *   Only derived metadata/knowledge is persisted to the Nucleus Database.
*   Access to user data is governed by the permissions granted during the OAuth flow, respecting the source system's controls.

### Where Sensitive Information is Okay

The artifacts uploaded in conversation by users for use by a Nucleus persona, as well as any artifacts that Nucleus personas themselves generate (analyses, reports, interactive visualizations, notes, tasks, etc.) are stored in the user's designated cloud storage (e.g., OneDrive, GDrive, Sharepoint, etc.). In terms of persistent storage, this is the only location that is acceptable. We do not want to house sensitive information in Nucleus.

However, **transient** sensitive data is acceptable. This may come in the form of:
- In-memory session data (i.e. embeddings, responses, etc.)
- Transient data during processing (e.g., temporary files, in-progress calculations, etc.)
- Prompt/response caches provided by AI/Inference providers (so long as the inference provider has appropriate policies to prevent data retention)

### Where Sensitive Information is Not Okay

**The database!**
It is a simultaneous optimization and security feature to **not** house raw files or sensitive data in Cosmos. Instead, personas write metadata about/impressions of the various inputs that an artifact ID has been generated for (i.e. message, attachment, etc.). 

One additional benefit that this secure design allows is for tagging of files with the specific type of content they contain, should a future persona attempt to retrieve its raw contents once more. This can further enhance searches in the future. 

## 3. Authentication & Authorization (AuthN/AuthZ)

A multi-layered approach handles user identity and access to resources.

*   **User Authentication (Nucleus Login):**
    *   **Cloud-Hosted:** Users authenticate via a primary identity provider (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID - formerly Azure AD, Google Identity) using OpenID Connect (OIDC).
    *   **Self-Hosted:** Configurable to use the organization's preferred IdP (Entra ID, Okta, etc.) via OIDC or potentially SAML.
*   **Storage Provider Authentication (OAuth 2.0):**
    *   To access files in the user's cloud storage (OneDrive, SharePoint, GDrive), Nucleus initiates a separate OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, specific to that storage provider.
    *   The user grants Nucleus (represented by its Client ID) explicit permission to access their files.
    *   This flow is initiated via the [Client/Adapter](./05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md) layer.
    *   Nucleus requests specific, least-privilege scopes (e.g., read-only access if sufficient, details in [Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)).
*   **Token Management:**
    *   **Hosted Model (Transitory Access):**
        *   **MUST NOT** request the `offline_access` scope during the storage OAuth flow.
        *   Obtains short-lived **access tokens** only.
        *   Stores access tokens securely, associated with the active backend user session (e.g., encrypted server-side cache).
        *   Tokens are discarded when the user session ends.
    *   **Self-Hosted Model (Optional Persistent Access):**
        *   Persistent background access requires an **explicit configuration flag** (`EnableBackgroundStorageAccess: true`).
        *   If enabled, **MAY** request the `offline_access` scope during storage OAuth flow.
        *   If requested and granted, receives a **refresh token** in addition to the access token.
        *   **CRITICAL:** The hosting organization is **solely responsible** for storing refresh tokens with extreme security (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, HSM-backed encryption). Nucleus code provides the mechanism but relies on secure infrastructure configuration.
        *   Background workers use the refresh token to obtain new access tokens as needed.
*   **RBAC Delegation:** Nucleus operates within the permissions granted through the OAuth consent flow. Access control to specific files/folders within the user/team storage is **governed by the underlying storage provider's RBAC rules** ([Storage Architecture](./03_ARCHITECTURE_STORAGE.md)), not by Nucleus itself.

## 4. Secrets Management

All sensitive configuration values must be managed securely.

*   **Secrets Include:** [AI Service](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) API Keys, [Database](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md) Connection Strings, Message Queue Connection Strings, OAuth Client IDs/Secrets, Token Signing Keys, Refresh Tokens (Self-Hosted).
*   **Mandatory Practice:** Use secure secret management solutions appropriate for the [deployment](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) environment:
    *   **Cloud-Hosted:** Azure Key Vault, integrated with App Services/Functions via Managed Identity.
    *   **Self-Hosted:** Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets (with appropriate backend), secure environment variables.
*   **Policy:** **NO hardcoded secrets** in source code or configuration files checked into version control.

## 5. Infrastructure Security

Secure configuration of underlying infrastructure (detailed in [Deployment Architecture](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)) is essential.

*   **Network Security:** Employ standard practices like network segmentation, firewalls, and potentially Private Endpoints (especially for Self-Hosted access to PaaS services like [Cosmos DB](./04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md)/Service Bus).
*   **Service Configuration:** Apply least-privilege principles to service identities (e.g., Managed Identities), database access rules, storage account security settings (network rules, access keys), API security (authentication, rate limiting).

## 6. AI & Prompt Security

Leverage platform capabilities and best practices.

*   **Provider Safeguards:** Rely primarily on the **built-in safety features and content filters** provided by the chosen AI service providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI Content Filters, Google Gemini Safety Settings). Configure these appropriately according to policy and use case.
*   **Input Handling:** While provider filters are the main defense, basic input sanitization on user prompts can add a layer of defense against simple injection attempts.
*   **Data Minimization:** [Personas](./02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) should be designed to only send necessary context (**retrieved snippets/derived data**, query) to the AI provider, minimizing exposure of potentially sensitive data.

## 7. Compliance & Auditing

*   **Audit Logs (Future):** While not detailed in V1.0, future iterations, particularly for team/enterprise use, may require robust audit logging of user actions, data access, and administrative changes. The architecture should facilitate adding such capabilities later (e.g., logging interactions via the [API layer](./07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md), [processing events](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)).

This document serves as the guiding framework for security decisions within the Nucleus OmniRAG project. It will be updated as the architecture evolves.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Deployment Architecture Overview

**Version:** 2.2
**Date:** 2025-04-13

This document provides a high-level overview of the deployment architecture for the Nucleus OmniRAG system, complementing the [System Architecture Overview](./00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). It establishes the core principles and links to detailed strategies for specific deployment targets.

## 1. Core Philosophy

The deployment architecture prioritizes:

*   **Flexibility:** Enabling deployment across different environments (cloud providers, self-hosted) based on needs.
*   **Leveraging Managed Services (where applicable):** Minimizing infrastructure management overhead when using cloud providers.
*   **Containerization:** Packaging application components into containers for consistent deployment and scaling.
*   **Scalability:** Designing components to scale independently based on load.
*   **Configuration Management:** Securely managing configuration and secrets across environments.

## 2. Abstract Deployment Requirements

Regardless of the specific target environment, Nucleus OmniRAG fundamentally requires a set of core infrastructure capabilities. These abstract requirements are defined in detail in:

*   **[Deployment Abstractions](./Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md):** Defines the necessary compute runtime, asynchronous messaging (Pub/Sub), document/vector database, and object storage components in a provider-agnostic way.

Understanding these abstractions is key to mapping the system onto different infrastructure platforms.

## 3. Specific Deployment Strategies

Based on the abstract requirements, detailed deployment strategies have been outlined for common target environments. These documents specify the chosen services, configuration considerations, networking, security, and IaC approaches for each:

*   **[Azure Deployment Strategy](./Deployment/Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_AZURE.md):** Details the recommended architecture using Azure services like Container Apps, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, and Blob Storage.
*   **[Cloudflare Deployment Strategy](./Deployment/Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_CLOUDFLARE.md):** Explores a potential architecture leveraging Cloudflare Workers, Queues, Vectorize, R2, and D1, focusing on cost-efficiency and edge performance.
*   **[Self-Hosted Home Network Strategy](./Deployment/Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_SELFHOST_HOMENETWORK.md):** Outlines deploying Nucleus locally using Docker containers for components like RabbitMQ/NATS and PostgreSQL/pgvector.

Refer to these specific documents for implementation details relevant to your chosen deployment target.

## 4. CI/CD Strategy (Open Source)

Given the open-source nature of Nucleus, the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) strategy focuses on validating code quality and producing consumable artifacts (like Docker images) rather than deploying to a specific instance. The approach is detailed in:

*   **[CI/CD Strategy for Open Source](./Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CICD_OSS.md):** Outlines the use of GitHub Actions for building, testing, packaging, and releasing versioned artifacts securely.

## 5. Next Steps (Cross-Cutting Concerns)

Regardless of the chosen deployment strategy, several key steps and considerations remain crucial for a successful implementation:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Develop templates (e.g., Bicep, Terraform, `docker-compose.yml`) to provision the chosen infrastructure repeatably, fulfilling a key aspect of [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#33-enterprise-readiness--admin-features) (REQ-P4-ADM-005).
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create automated pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps Pipelines, GitHub Actions) to build application artifacts (container images, Worker bundles), push them to a registry (if applicable), and deploy updates to the target environment.
3.  **Monitoring Setup:** Configure appropriate monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Application Insights, Cloudflare Analytics, Prometheus/Grafana) for observability.
4.  **Cost Analysis:** Estimate and monitor costs based on expected usage patterns for the chosen services and tiers.
5.  **Backup and Recovery:** Define and test backup/recovery strategies for databases and object storage, as required by [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#33-enterprise-readiness--admin-features) (REQ-P4-ADM-006).

# Client Adapter: Console


## Overview

Describes a basic interaction surface with Nucleus personas, tailored for accelerated local development and providing a lightweight simulation environment for core adapter interactions. It serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) client described in the main [Client Architecture document](../05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md).

This adapter implements the common interfaces defined in [ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md](./ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md), with specific mappings detailed in [Console Adapter Interfaces](./Console/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_CONSOLE_INTERFACES.md).

## Auth

No specific authentication model is required for the basic console adapter. It runs under the local user's context.

## Generated Artifact Handling

The Console Adapter acts as a conduit to the Nucleus API, interacting with the local filesystem primarily for initiating uploads and handling generated outputs.

*   **Source Artifacts (Upload):** When using commands like `nucleus ingest --path <local_file_path>`, the Console Adapter reads the specified file from the user's local filesystem and sends its content to the Nucleus API for ingestion.
*   **Generated Outputs (Handling):** Outputs generated by personas (e.g., summaries, analysis results, visualizations) are received from the Nucleus API as part of query responses.
    *   **Terminal Display:** By default, textual outputs are displayed directly in the terminal.
    *   **Local File Persistence (Configurable):**
        *   The adapter **should** support saving generated artifacts to a configurable local directory (e.g., `./.nucleus/console_outputs/` relative to the working directory, which should be added to `.gitignore`).
        *   This behavior might be enabled via a configuration setting or a command-line flag (e.g., `--save-output`).
        *   This is crucial for non-textual artifacts (e.g., images, PDFs, HTML files) or for easily reviewing complex textual outputs.
        *   Files could be named using conventions like `{PersonaId}_{Timestamp}_{OutputName}.ext` or based on details from the API response.
    *   **Explicit Output Path:** Commands may still support an explicit `--output <file_path>` argument to override the default save location for a specific execution.
*   **No Backend Persistent Storage Management:** The Console Adapter itself does not manage persistent storage in the way the Teams adapter interacts with SharePoint's `.Nucleus` structure. It relies on the Nucleus backend for primary persistence (Cosmos DB) and the local filesystem for sourcing uploads and optionally saving generated outputs.

## Messaging

The console uses a simple linear sequence of inputs and outputs.

*   **Platform Representation:** A sequence of user inputs and application outputs.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping:**
    *   Each line of user input and each distinct block of Nucleus output can be treated as a separate artifact.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Console`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Generated based on a session ID and sequence number (e.g., `console://session-uuid/input-0`, `console://session-uuid/output-1`).
    *   `sourceUri`: Not applicable.
    *   `displayName`: First N characters of the input/output text.
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`: Timestamp of the input/output event.

## Conversations

While lacking the rich threading of platforms like Teams or Slack, the console adapter can **simulate basic conversation context** for development and testing purposes.

*   **Session Context:** Each run of the console application can be considered a session. Input/output sequences within a session can be linked.
*   **(Optional) Local State:** A simple local mechanism (e.g., session IDs maintained in memory, a lightweight SQLite database, or simple state files within the configured local directory) could be used to group interactions within a session or even across short-lived sessions, allowing simulation of `replyTo` or simple threading logic for testing Personas.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping:**
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`: Could link to a conceptual "session artifact" or a previous turn within the session simulation.
    *   `replyToSourceIdentifier`, `threadSourceIdentifier`: Can be populated based on the simulated local state if implemented.

## Attachments

Standard console I/O does not have a native concept of attachments like other communication platforms.

*   **Handling:** File paths provided as input arguments are the primary way to reference external files.

## Rich Presentations and Embedded Hypermedia

Presentation capabilities are limited to standard console text output. The adapter **cannot render** rich HTML, interactive visualizations, or images directly.

*   **Artifact Referencing:** However, when a Persona generates a rich artifact (like a `viz.html` file stored locally via the Generated Artifact Handling mechanism described above), the console adapter **can present a reference** to it (e.g., printing the local file path or a `file://` hyperlink) allowing the developer to open and view it manually.
*   **Simulation Focus:** The primary goal is to test the Persona's ability to *request* and *generate* the rich artifact payload, not the final rendering within the console itself.

## Limitations

Presentation capabilities are limited to standard console text output.

*   **Limitations:** No support for interactive elements, complex formatting (beyond basic ANSI colors/styles), or embedded visualizations like those described in [ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md](../Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md).

# Client Adapter: Discord


## Overview

Enables interaction with Nucleus Personas within the Discord platform (Servers/Guilds, Channels, Threads).


## Auth

Requires a Discord Bot Token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. Permissions (Scopes and Privileged Intents like Message Content) must be configured appropriately for the bot.


## Persistent Storage

*   **Conversations:** Discord stores message history persistently according to server/channel settings.
*   **Generated Artifacts:** Personas can generate artifacts (files). The Discord Adapter **must** use the Discord API to upload these files back into the relevant channel/thread. Nucleus then creates `ArtifactMetadata` for the uploaded file using the `sourceIdentifier` and `sourceUri` provided by the Discord API upon successful upload. Local storage by Nucleus is avoided for generated content destined for Discord.


## Messaging

Handles individual messages within Discord channels or threads.

*   **Platform Representation:** Message objects containing text, attachments, embeds, author, timestamp, etc.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Messages):**
    *   Each Message gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Discord`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Generated using Discord's unique IDs (e.g., `discord://message/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID`).
    *   `sourceUri`: Constructed message link (e.g., `https://discord.com/channels/GUILD_ID/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID`).
    *   `displayName`: First N characters of message content.
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`, `sourceLastModifiedAt`: Timestamps provided by the Discord API.
    *   `sourceCreatedByUserId`: Discord User ID.
    *   `originatingContext`: Could store `{ "guildId": "...", "channelId": "...", "threadId": "..." }`.


## Conversations

Manages the context of Guilds, Channels, and Threads.

*   **Platform Representation:** Guild (Server), Channel (Text/Voice), Thread (sub-conversation).
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Containers):**
    *   Guilds, Channels, and Threads can each be represented by an `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Discord`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: e.g., `discord://guild/GUILD_ID`, `discord://channel/CHANNEL_ID`, `discord://thread/THREAD_ID`.
    *   `displayName`: Guild/Channel/Thread name.
*   **Relationships (`ArtifactMetadata`):**
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`:
        *   Channel: Guild's `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Message in Channel: Channel's `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Thread: Channel's `sourceIdentifier` (or initiating message's `sourceIdentifier`).
        *   Message in Thread: Thread's `sourceIdentifier`.
    *   `replyToSourceIdentifier`: Message's `sourceIdentifier` if it's a direct Discord reply.
    *   `threadSourceIdentifier`: Set to the Thread's `sourceIdentifier` for all messages within that thread.


## Attachments

Handles files and rich content previews associated with messages.

*   **Platform Representation:** Attachment or Embed objects linked to a Message.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping:**
    *   Attachments/Embeds can optionally have their own `ArtifactMetadata` (especially if they are files to be processed).
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Discord`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: e.g., `discord://attachment/MESSAGE_ID/ATTACHMENT_ID`.
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`: Message's `sourceIdentifier`.


## Rich Presentations and Embedded Hypermedia

Discord offers several ways to present information richly.

*   **Markdown:** Supports a flavor of Markdown for text formatting.
*   **Embeds:** Discord's primary mechanism for rich, structured messages. Ideal for presenting summaries, links, small tables, or previews. Personas should generate content suitable for Embeds.
*   **Buttons & Select Menus:** Interactive components can be added to messages for user actions (requires bot interaction logic).
*   **Custom Apps/Bots & Visualizations:**
    *   While Nucleus acts as a bot, complex UIs might require dedicated Discord Apps.
    *   Interactive data visualizations ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md](cci:7://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Docs/Architecture/Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md:0:0-0:0)) are best presented by generating the viz, saving it as an image/HTML file, uploading it back to Discord, and providing a link/preview embed, rather than direct embedding.

## Generated Artifact Handling

*   **Conversations:** Discord stores message history persistently according to server/channel settings.
*   **Generated Artifacts:** Personas can generate artifacts (files). The Discord Adapter **must** use the Discord API to upload these files back into the relevant channel/thread. Nucleus then creates `ArtifactMetadata` for the uploaded file using the `sourceIdentifier` and `sourceUri` provided by the Discord API upon successful upload. Local storage by Nucleus is avoided for generated content destined for Discord.

version: 1.1
date: 2025-04-13

# Client Adapter: Email


## Overview

Enables interaction with Nucleus Personas via email (e.g., reading monitored mailboxes, sending replies).


## Auth

Depends on the chosen protocol:
*   **IMAP/SMTP:** Requires mailbox credentials (username/password or App Password).
*   **Microsoft Graph API:** Requires Azure AD App Registration with appropriate permissions (e.g., `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`) and authentication (client credentials or managed identity).


## Generated Artifact Handling

*   **Conversations:** Email messages are stored persistently on the email server (e.g., Exchange, Gmail, IMAP server).
*   **Generated Artifacts:** Personas can generate artifacts (files, reports). The Email Adapter **must** use the appropriate email protocol (e.g., MS Graph API, SMTP/IMAP) to:
    *   Option 1: Send a *new email* containing the generated artifact as an attachment (potentially replying to the triggering email if contextually appropriate).
    *   Option 2 (If using Graph API for M365): Potentially save the artifact to the user's OneDrive and include a link in a reply email.
*   Nucleus then creates `ArtifactMetadata` for the newly sent email or the uploaded file, using identifiers returned by the email/storage system.


## Messaging

Handles individual email messages.

*   **Platform Representation:** The core unit is the Message, containing headers (From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References), body (plain text and/or HTML), and attachments.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Messages):**
    *   Each email message gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Email`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Derived from the unique `Message-ID` header (e.g., `email://<MESSAGE_ID_HASH_OR_RAW>`).
    *   `sourceUri`: Not directly applicable for Nucleus access; requires API calls using message ID. Could store API-specific ID (e.g., Graph message ID).
    *   `displayName`: Email Subject line.
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`: From the `Date` header.
    *   `sourceLastModifiedAt`: Not typically applicable for emails once sent.
    *   `sourceCreatedByUserId`: From the `From` header (email address).
    *   `originatingContext`: Could store mailbox ID, folder name, etc.


## Conversations

Handles email threading.

*   **Platform Representation:** Threading is not an explicit object but is reconstructed using the `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (Relationships):**
    *   `replyToSourceIdentifier`: Derived from the `In-Reply-To` header, mapping the referenced Message-ID to its corresponding `sourceIdentifier` in Nucleus (requires lookup).
    *   `threadSourceIdentifier`: Can be derived by analyzing the `References` header chain to find the root message's `sourceIdentifier` (complex, requires lookup and potentially heuristics).


## Attachments

Handles files embedded within messages.

*   **Platform Representation:** Files embedded within a message MIME structure.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping:**
    *   Each distinct attachment gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Email`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: e.g., `email://<MESSAGE_ID_HASH_OR_RAW>/attachment/CONTENT_ID_OR_INDEX`.
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`: The `sourceIdentifier` of the containing email message.
    *   `displayName`: Attachment filename.


## Rich Presentations and Embedded Hypermedia

Email presentation capabilities vary by client.

*   **HTML:** Email bodies can contain rich HTML formatting.
*   **Interactivity:** Limited. Some clients support basic forms or actions (e.g., Outlook Actionable Messages), but general interactivity is minimal.
*   **Embedded Visualizations:** Not directly supported. Interactive data visualizations would need to be rendered as static images (PNG) embedded in the HTML body, or saved as files (HTML, SVG, PNG) and attached, with a link provided in the email body.

# Client Adapter: Slack


## Overview

Enables interaction with Nucleus Personas within a Slack workspace.

## Auth

Requires a Slack Bot Token obtained from the Slack App administration interface. Necessary permissions (scopes) must be granted, potentially including privileged intents depending on required functionality.

## Generated Artifact Handling

*   **Conversations & Files:** Slack stores message history and uploaded files persistently based on workspace plan/settings.
*   **Generated Artifacts:** Personas generate artifacts (files, reports, visualization images/data). The Slack Adapter **must** use the Slack API (`files.upload` or newer methods) to upload these artifacts back into the relevant channel or thread. Nucleus then creates `ArtifactMetadata` for the uploaded file using the identifiers (`id`, `permalink`) returned by the Slack API.

## Messaging

Handles individual messages within Slack channels or threads.

*   **Platform Representation:** Message objects, composed of text and/or structured 'Blocks'. Can include files.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Messages):**
    *   Each message gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Slack`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Generated using Slack's unique IDs (e.g., `slack://message/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP`). Example: `slack://message/C67890/p1678886400.123456`.
    *   `sourceUri`: Slack permalink for the message (e.g., `https://yourteam.slack.com/archives/C67890/p1678886400.123456`).
    *   `displayName`: First N chars of message text.
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`, `sourceLastModifiedAt`: Timestamps from the Slack API (message `ts`).
    *   `sourceCreatedByUserId`: Slack User ID.
    *   `originatingContext`: Could store `{ "teamId": "...", "channelId": "...", "threadTs": "..." }`.

## Conversations

Manages the context of Workspaces, Channels, and Threads.

*   **Platform Representation:** Workspace (Team), Channel (Public/Private), Thread (sub-conversation initiated from a message).
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Containers):**
    *   Workspaces, Channels, and potentially Thread *root messages* can be represented by `ArtifactMetadata` records.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Slack`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: e.g., `slack://team/T12345`, `slack://channel/C67890`, potentially `slack://thread/CHANNEL_ID/THREAD_ROOT_TS`.
    *   `displayName`: Workspace/Channel name.
*   **Relationships (`ArtifactMetadata`):**
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`:
        *   Channel: Workspace `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Message in Channel (not in thread): Channel `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Thread's root message: Channel `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Message replying within a Thread: The *thread root message's* `sourceIdentifier` (identified by `thread_ts` field in the message).
    *   `replyToSourceIdentifier`: Not explicitly a Slack concept like email, but could potentially identify the message being replied to if it's the start of a thread (using `thread_ts`).
    *   `threadSourceIdentifier`: Set to the *thread root message's* `sourceIdentifier` (e.g., `slack://message/CHANNEL_ID/THREAD_ROOT_TS`) for all messages within that thread (including the root message itself).

## Attachments

Handles files uploaded to Slack.

*   **Platform Representation:** File objects, associated with channels or messages.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping:**
    *   Each File gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `Slack`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Slack File ID (e.g., `slack://file/FABCDEF`).
    *   `sourceUri`: Slack permalink for the file.
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`:
        *   File uploaded directly to channel: Channel `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   File attached to a message: Message `sourceIdentifier`.
    *   `displayName`: Filename.

## Rich Presentations and Embedded Hypermedia

Slack offers rich presentation options via Block Kit.

*   **Slack Blocks:** The primary method. Personas should generate structured output suitable for formatting as Block Kit JSON (text, images, dividers, context, buttons, menus, etc.).
*   **Markdown:** Slack uses `mrkdwn`, a variant of Markdown, within text blocks.
*   **Interactive Components:** Buttons, select menus, date pickers etc., can be included in Block Kit messages, enabling user interaction (requires bot interaction handling).
*   **Embedded Visualizations:** Complex interactive visualizations ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md](cci:7://file:///d:/Projects/Nucleus/Docs/Architecture/Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md:0:0-0:0)) are best handled by:
    1.  Generating as a static image (PNG) and uploading via `files.upload`, displayed inline.
    2.  Generating an interactive HTML file, uploading it via `files.upload`, and providing a link/button in the message.
    3.  Direct embedding within Slack messages is not feasible for complex JS-based visualizations.

# Client Adapter: Teams

## Overview

The Teams Client Adapter (`Nucleus.Adapters.Teams`) serves as the bridge between the core Nucleus OmniRAG platform and the Microsoft Teams environment, as introduced in the main [Client Architecture document](../05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md). It enables users to interact with Nucleus Personas through familiar Teams interfaces like chat messages, channel conversations, and potentially Adaptive Cards. The adapter leverages the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK and Microsoft Graph API to handle communication, file access, and presentation within Teams.

This adapter implements the common interfaces defined in [ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md](./ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md), with specific mappings detailed in [Teams Adapter Interfaces](./Teams/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS_INTERFACES.md).

## Auth

*   **Bot Authentication:** Relies on standard Bot Framework authentication mechanisms (App ID/Password or Managed Identity) configured during bot registration in Azure Bot Service / Azure AD.
*   **User Authentication:** User identity is typically derived from the Teams context provided in incoming activities.
*   **Graph API Access:** Requires separate Azure AD App Registration with appropriate Microsoft Graph API permissions (e.g., `Sites.Selected`, `Files.ReadWrite`, `User.Read`, `ChannelMessage.Send`) granted via admin consent. Authentication uses client credentials flow or Managed Identity.

## Generated Artifact Handling

Nucleus integrates with the **native storage mechanisms** of Microsoft Teams, primarily SharePoint Online for channel files and OneDrive for Business for chat files. Nucleus itself **does not persist raw user content** within its own managed storage (See Memory `08b60bec`). Instead, it interacts with the Team's designated storage location.

*   **Source File Storage:** Files shared in channels are stored in the Team's SharePoint Online document library. Files shared in 1:1 or group chats are stored in the sender's OneDrive for Business.
*   **Conversation Storage:** Messages are stored persistently within Microsoft 365.
*   **Nucleus-Managed Structure (within Team SharePoint):** To store metadata and generated outputs persistently within the user's control, Nucleus utilizes a specific structure within the Team's *default SharePoint document library root*:
    *   **`.Nucleus/`**: Hidden root directory for Nucleus data.
        *   **`ArtifactMetadata/` (Optional & Configurable):**
            *   If enabled via configuration, a JSON copy of the `ArtifactMetadata` record (excluding sensitive fields) generated during ingestion can be stored here, named using the `ArtifactId` (e.g., `{ArtifactId}.json`).
            *   **Purpose:** Provides a human-readable record within the Team's storage, potentially useful for auditing or manual inspection. Disabled by default to minimize storage consumption.
        *   **`Personas/`**: Root directory for outputs generated by specific personas.
            *   **`{PersonaId}/`**: Directory specific to a persona (e.g., `EduFlowOmniEducator`).
                *   **`GeneratedOutputs/`**: Contains artifacts generated by the persona (e.g., reports, visualizations).
                    *   Files are typically named using a convention involving the source `ArtifactId` or `IngestionId` and a descriptive name (e.g., `{ArtifactId}_Q1_LearningSummary.md`, `{IngestionId}_ProgressReport.pdf`).
                    *   The exact structure and format are determined by the persona implementation.
*   **Linking:** `ArtifactMetadata` stored in Nucleus's primary database (Cosmos DB) contains the necessary pointers (`sourceIdentifier`, `sourceUri`) to link back to the original files in SharePoint/OneDrive.

This approach ensures that while Nucleus performs processing, the generated knowledge artifacts and optional metadata copies remain within the organizational boundaries and storage managed by the Team.

## Messaging

*   **Receiving:** Handles incoming Activity objects (e.g., `message`, `invoke`) via Bot Framework. Parses messages for user intent, @mentions, context, and attached files.
*   **Sending:** Sends messages back using `TurnContext.SendActivityAsync`. Can send plain text, mentions, and attachments (Adaptive Cards, File Consent Cards).
*   **Platform Representation:** Message objects within a channel or chat. Can contain text, @mentions, files, Adaptive Cards.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Messages):**
    *   Each Message gets its own `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `MSTeams`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Generated using Graph API IDs (e.g., `msteams://message/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID` or `msteams://message/CHAT_ID/MESSAGE_ID`).
    *   `sourceUri`: Graph API endpoint URL or Teams deep link (e.g., `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID?...`).
    *   `displayName`: First N chars of message text.
    *   `sourceCreatedAt`, `sourceLastModifiedAt`: Timestamps from Graph API.
    *   `sourceCreatedByUserId`: Azure AD User ID.
    *   `originatingContext`: Could store `{ "teamId": "...", "channelId": "...", "chatId": "...", "messageId": "..." }`.

## Conversations

*   Leverages Bot Framework conversation management (`ConversationReference`, state) for context.
*   **Platform Representation:** Team (M365 Group), Channel (within Team), Chat (1:1 or Group), Reply/Thread (in channel messages).
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Containers):**
    *   Teams, Channels, and Chats can each be represented by `ArtifactMetadata` records.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `MSTeams`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Graph API IDs (e.g., `msteams://team/TEAM_ID`, `msteams://channel/CHANNEL_ID`, `msteams://chat/CHAT_ID`).
    *   `displayName`: Team/Channel/Chat name.
*   **Relationships (`ArtifactMetadata`):**
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`:
        *   Channel: Team `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Message in Channel (root): Channel `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Reply in Channel Thread: Root message's `sourceIdentifier`.
        *   Message in Chat: Chat `sourceIdentifier`.
    *   `replyToSourceIdentifier`: For a reply message in a channel thread, this links to the *root message's* `sourceIdentifier`.
    *   `threadSourceIdentifier`: For channel messages, this would typically be the *root message's* `sourceIdentifier` for all messages in that thread.

## Attachments

*   **Receiving:** Detects file attachments shared in messages. Retrieves file metadata and content via Graph API. Initiates Nucleus ingestion (storing file via `IFileStorage`, creating `ArtifactMetadata` - `sourceSystemType` is `SharePoint`/`OneDrive` for the file itself).
*   **Sending:** Can send `FileCard` or `FileConsentCard` attachments linking to files stored in SharePoint/OneDrive, including generated artifacts.
*   **Platform Representation:** File reference within a message, linking to SharePoint/OneDrive.
*   **Nucleus `ArtifactMetadata` Mapping (for Files):**
    *   Each distinct file gets its own primary `ArtifactMetadata` record.
    *   `sourceSystemType`: Set to `SharePoint` or `OneDrive`.
    *   `sourceIdentifier`: Graph API DriveItem ID (e.g., `spo://drive/DRIVE_ID/item/ITEM_ID`).
    *   `sourceUri`: File's `webUrl` from Graph API.
    *   `parentSourceIdentifier`: While a file exists independently, when attached to a Teams message, the *message's* `ArtifactMetadata` can reference the file's `sourceIdentifier`. This reflects the context of sharing, not ownership.
    *   `displayName`: Filename.

## Rich Presentations and Embedded Hypermedia

A key capability of the Teams Adapter is presenting rich, interactive content generated by Personas, specifically **Pyodide-based Data Visualizations**.

### Pyodide Visualization Delivery Mechanism

1.  **Trigger:** The adapter receives a response payload from a Persona indicating a data visualization is requested, including the Python script snippet and JSON data.
2.  **Artifact Generation (`viz.html`):**
    *   The adapter loads the standard `template.html` for visualizations.
    *   Injects branding CSS, the escaped Python script, and the JSON data into the template, generating the final HTML content string.
    *   (See [ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md](../Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md) for details on the template and generation process).
3.  **SharePoint Storage:**
    *   Uses the Graph API to upload the generated `viz.html` content string to the `.Nucleus/Artifacts/` folder within the SharePoint site associated with the current Teams context (e.g., the Team's default site).
    *   Stores the `webUrl` or item ID of the uploaded file. Creates `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records for this file.
4.  **Caching:**
    *   Generates a unique identifier (`vizId`).
    *   Stores the complete `viz.html` content string in a local cache (e.g., `IMemoryCache` managed within the adapter's service) associated with the `vizId`. Sets an appropriate expiration time (e.g., 15-30 minutes). This cache improves responsiveness for immediate Task Module viewing.
5.  **Task Module Invocation:**
    *   Creates an Adaptive Card to send to the user/channel.
    *   The card includes:
        *   Contextual information about the visualization (e.g., "Persona generated a visualization: [Title]").
        *   An `Action.Submit` button labeled "View Interactive" (or similar).
        *   The button's `data` payload includes `{"msteams": {"type": "task/fetch"}, "vizId": "UNIQUE_VIZ_ID"}`.
        *   (Optional) An `Action.OpenUrl` button linking directly to the artifact stored in SharePoint (`webUrl` from step 3).
    *   Sends the Adaptive Card using `TurnContext.SendActivityAsync`.
6.  **Task Module Fetch Handling (`OnTeamsTaskModuleFetchAsync`):**
    *   The adapter implements the `OnTeamsTaskModuleFetchAsync` method (or equivalent Bot Framework v4 handler).
    *   When the user clicks the "View Interactive" button, this method is invoked.
    *   It parses the `vizId` from the incoming `taskModuleRequest.Data`.
    *   It validates the `vizId` and checks if the corresponding HTML content exists in the cache.
    *   It constructs the URL pointing to an endpoint hosted *within this Teams Adapter application* (e.g., `https://<your-bot-service-domain>/api/renderViz?id={vizId}`).
    *   It returns a `TaskModuleResponse` containing a `TaskModuleContinueResponse` with the `url`, desired dimensions (`height`, `width`), and `title` for the Task Module.
7.  **HTML Serving Endpoint (`/api/renderViz`):**
    *   The Teams Adapter ASP.NET Core application hosts a minimal API endpoint (e.g., mapped via `app.MapGet` or a dedicated controller).
    *   This endpoint receives GET requests with the `id` query parameter (`vizId`).
    *   It attempts to retrieve the corresponding `viz.html` content string from the `IMemoryCache`.
    *   **If not cached (or as fallback):** It could potentially use the `vizId` (if it maps to the SharePoint item ID) or related context to fetch the `viz.html` content directly from SharePoint via Graph API.
    *   If found (from cache or SharePoint), it returns the HTML content with `Content-Type: text/html` and, critically, appropriate **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers. The CSP must allow:
        *   Scripts from `'self'`, `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'`, Pyodide CDN, Plotly CDN.
        *   Styles from `'self'`, `'unsafe-inline'`. 
        *   Images from `'self'`, `data:`.
        *   Worker scripts from `'self'`, `blob:`.
        *   Connections (`connect-src`) ideally restricted to `'self'` unless external data is needed *by the visualization JS itself* (unlikely for this pattern).
        *   **Crucially:** `frame-ancestors` allowing embedding within Teams domains (`https://teams.microsoft.com`, `https://*.teams.microsoft.com`, etc.).
    *   If not found, it returns `NotFound` or an appropriate error page.
8.  **Rendering:** Teams opens the Task Module, loads the URL, receives the HTML from the `/api/renderViz` endpoint, and renders the `viz.html` page within the iframe. The JavaScript within the page then loads Pyodide in its worker, executes the Python script, and renders the interactive visualization.
9.  **Export:** Export functionality (PNG, SVG, HTML) is embedded within the `viz.html` JavaScript and operates entirely client-side within the Task Module context.

This mechanism allows the Teams Adapter to seamlessly present complex, interactive Python visualizations generated by Personas directly within the Teams user interface, leveraging Task Modules as the hosting container.

*   **Embedded Visualization Handling Summary:** Interactive visualizations ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md](../Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md)) are primarily delivered as self-contained HTML files, stored in SharePoint, and rendered within **Task Modules** via a serving endpoint hosted by the Teams Adapter Bot. Simpler representations might involve static images (PNG) embedded in Adaptive Cards.

## Processing Flow (Example - User @mentions Persona in Channel)

1.  **User Message:** User posts `@NucleusPersona create report based on file X` in a Teams channel.

# Architecture: Common Client Adapter Interfaces

This document defines conceptual C# interfaces and base classes representing common patterns and abstractions expected across different Nucleus Client Adapters (e.g., Console, Teams), as outlined in the main [Client Architecture](../05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md). These promote consistency and allow the core Nucleus API/services to interact with adapters in a standardized way where appropriate.

Implementations detailing how these interfaces are mapped to specific platforms can be found in:
*   [Console Adapter Interfaces](./Console/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_CONSOLE_INTERFACES.md)
*   [Teams Adapter Interfaces](./Teams/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS_INTERFACES.md)

## 1. `IPlatformMessage`

Represents a single, discrete message or event received from the client platform that might trigger Nucleus processing.

**Purpose:** To abstract the details of a specific platform message (e.g., Teams message, Console command line input) into a common structure usable by the Nucleus core.

**Conceptual Definition:**

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents a single message or event received from the client platform.
/// </summary>
public interface IPlatformMessage
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Unique identifier for the message within the platform (e.g., Teams message ID, a generated UUID for console input).
    /// </summary>
    string MessageId { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Identifier for the conversation or thread the message belongs to (e.g., Teams channel ID, chat ID, "console_session").
    /// </summary>
    string ConversationId { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Identifier for the user who sent the message (e.g., AAD Object ID, local username).
    /// </summary>
    string UserId { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The primary textual content of the message (e.g., text body, command line arguments).
    /// </summary>
    string Content { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Timestamp when the message was created or received on the platform.
    /// </summary>
    DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// URIs or identifiers pointing to any attached files or resources relevant to this message
    /// (e.g., `file://` URIs for console, SharePoint/OneDrive URIs/IDs for Teams).
    /// These are pointers to the *source* artifacts managed by the platform.
    /// </summary>
    IEnumerable<string> SourceArtifactUris { get; }

    // Potentially other platform-specific metadata accessible via methods or properties.
    // T GetMetadata<T>(string key);
}
```

## 2. `IPersonaInteractionContext`

Represents the context of a single user-initiated interaction or "micro-conversation" with a Persona, potentially spanning multiple messages over a short period (e.g., 5-60 minutes of activity). It's the primary object passed from the adapter into the Nucleus core for processing a specific task.

**Purpose:** To encapsulate all necessary information and capabilities required to process a user's interaction, including user identity, the originating message(s), and access to platform-specific resources like file I/O within the security context of that interaction. This aligns with the ephemeral processing model.

**Conceptual Definition:**

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Encapsulates the context of a single user interaction with a Persona.
/// Provides access to interaction details and platform-specific resources for the duration of the task.
/// </summary>
public interface IPersonaInteractionContext : IDisposable // Potentially disposable for resource cleanup
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Unique identifier for this specific interaction context.
    /// </summary>
    string InteractionId { get; } // Renamed from RequestId

    /// <summary>
    /// Identifier for the user initiating the interaction.
    /// </summary>
    string UserId { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Identifier for the originating platform (e.g., "Teams", "Console").
    /// </summary>
    string PlatformId { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The primary message(s) that initiated or are part of this interaction context.
    /// Could be a single message or potentially a sequence.
    /// </summary>
    IEnumerable<IPlatformMessage> TriggeringMessages { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to read source files referenced within this interaction context
    /// (e.g., files attached to triggering messages).
    /// </summary>
    ISourceFileReader SourceFileReader { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to write generated output artifacts back to the platform's
    /// designated storage location for this interaction context (e.g., Team's .Nucleus folder,
    /// local console output directory).
    /// </summary>
    IOutputWriter OutputWriter { get; }

    // May include methods for:
    // - Sending reply messages back to the platform (e.g., SendReplyAsync(string content))
    // - Accessing interaction-scoped configuration or services
    // - Tracking interaction duration/metrics
}
```

## 3. `ISourceFileReader`

An interface, accessed via `IPersonaInteractionContext`, responsible for retrieving the content of source artifacts referenced by their URIs.

**Purpose:** To abstract the platform-specific mechanism for accessing file content (e.g., Microsoft Graph API calls for Teams, local `File.OpenRead` for Console) during interaction processing.

**Conceptual Definition:**

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Provides read access to source artifacts referenced within a persona interaction context.
/// Implementation is platform-specific (e.g., Graph API, local filesystem).
/// </summary>
public interface ISourceFileReader
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if a source artifact exists and is accessible at the given URI within the current interaction context.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="sourceUri">The platform-specific URI or identifier of the source artifact.</param>
    /// <returns>True if accessible, false otherwise.</returns>
    Task<bool> SourceExistsAsync(string sourceUri, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    /// <summary>
    /// Opens a readable stream to the content of the specified source artifact.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="sourceUri">The platform-specific URI or identifier of the source artifact.</param>
    /// <returns>A readable Stream.</returns>
    /// <exception cref="FileNotFoundException">Thrown if the artifact does not exist or is inaccessible.</exception>
    Task<Stream> OpenReadSourceAsync(string sourceUri, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets basic metadata about the source artifact (e.g., name, size, last modified date).
    /// Actual metadata available will vary by platform.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="sourceUri">The platform-specific URI or identifier of the source artifact.</param>
    /// <returns>A dictionary or specific metadata object.</returns>
    Task<SourceArtifactMetadata> GetSourceMetadataAsync(string sourceUri, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

// Helper class for metadata
public record SourceArtifactMetadata(string Name, long? Size, DateTimeOffset? LastModified);
```

## 4. `IOutputWriter`

An interface, accessed via `IPersonaInteractionContext`, responsible for writing generated artifacts (including AI replies and associated media) back to the platform's designated storage area.

**Purpose:** To abstract the platform-specific mechanism for saving generated outputs (e.g., Microsoft Graph API uploads to SharePoint for Teams, local `File.Create` for Console).

**Conceptual Definition:**

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Provides write access to save generated output artifacts within a persona interaction context's
/// designated output location (e.g., Team's .Nucleus folder, console output dir).
/// Implementation is platform-specific.
/// </summary>
public interface IOutputWriter
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Writes the provided content stream as a generated output artifact.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="personaId">The ID of the persona generating the output.</param>
    /// <param name="outputName">A suggested name for the output artifact (e.g., "Q1_Summary.md", "analysis_chart.png"). The implementation may modify this for uniqueness or conventions.</param>
    /// <param name="contentStream">The stream containing the artifact content.</param>
    /// <param name="mimeType">Optional MIME type of the content.</param>
    /// <returns>The platform-specific URI or identifier of the created artifact.</returns>
    Task<string> WriteOutputAsync(
        string personaId,
        string outputName,
        Stream contentStream,
        string? mimeType = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    /// <summary>
    /// Writes a textual reply, potentially grouping it with other outputs from the same persona interaction.
    /// This might save the text as a file (e.g., .md) in the designated output location.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="personaId">The ID of the persona generating the reply.</param>
    /// <param name="replyContent">The textual content of the reply.</param>
    /// <param name="suggestedFileName">A suggested base name for the file if saved (e.g., "chat_reply").</param>
    /// <returns>The platform-specific URI or identifier if saved as a distinct artifact, otherwise null.</returns>
    Task<string?> WriteTextReplyAsync(
        string personaId,
        string replyContent,
        string suggestedFileName = "reply",
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    // Could potentially include methods for creating directories if needed by the platform structure.
    // Task EnsureOutputDirectoryExistsAsync(string personaId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

# Console Adapter: Interface Mapping

This document details the specific implementation patterns for the common client adapter interfaces defined in `../ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md` within the context of the [Console adapter (`Nucleus.Console`)](../ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_CONSOLE.md), primarily leveraging `System.CommandLine` and standard .NET filesystem/console APIs.

## 1. `IPlatformMessage` Implementation

Corresponds to a single parsed command invocation via `System.CommandLine`.

*   **`MessageId`**: A unique ID generated for this specific command invocation (e.g., `Guid.NewGuid().ToString()`), as console input doesn't have an inherent persistent ID.
*   **`ConversationId`**: Can be considered a constant like `"console_session"` or potentially derived from the current working directory or a session identifier if multi-session support is added later. For simplicity, `"console_session"` is likely sufficient initially.
*   **`UserId`**: Maps to the local system's current user principal name or username (e.g., `Environment.UserName`).
*   **`Content`**: Represents the core arguments or text provided to the command after parsing (e.g., the `<prompt>` value in `nucleus query --persona <name> "<prompt>"`). Command names/options themselves are handled by `System.CommandLine` before this stage.
*   **`Timestamp`**: `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` at the time the command is processed.
*   **`SourceArtifactUris`**: Derived from command-line arguments specifying local file paths (e.g., the `<filepath>` in `nucleus ingest --path <filepath>`). These should be resolved to absolute `file://` URIs.

## 2. `IPersonaInteractionContext` Implementation

Represents the scope of processing a single command execution. It's typically created within the command's handler delegate provided to `System.CommandLine`.

*   **`InteractionId`**: The same unique ID generated for the corresponding `IPlatformMessage`.
*   **`UserId`**: Sourced from `Environment.UserName`.
*   **`PlatformId`**: Hardcoded as `"Console"`.
*   **`TriggeringMessages`**: Contains the `IPlatformMessage` wrapper around the current command invocation details.
*   **`SourceFileReader`**: An instance of a `ConsoleSourceFileReader` (see below).
*   **`OutputWriter`**: An instance of a `ConsoleOutputWriter` (see below). Requires access to configuration specifying the output directory (if configured).
*   **Disposal (`Dispose`)**: Might clean up temporary resources if any were created. Generally less complex than the Teams context.
*   **Additional Capabilities**: Might hold references to console output mechanisms (like `Spectre.Console`'s `IAnsiConsole`) or command-specific parsed options.

## 3. `ISourceFileReader` Implementation (`ConsoleSourceFileReader`)

Uses standard .NET `System.IO` APIs.

*   **`SourceExistsAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Parses the `file://` URI, converts it to a local path, and uses `File.Exists(path)`. Asynchronous wrapper might be trivial (`Task.FromResult(File.Exists(path))`).
*   **`OpenReadSourceAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Parses the `file://` URI, converts it to a local path, and returns `File.OpenRead(path)`. Requires error handling for `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`, etc. Wraps the synchronous call in `Task.FromResult`.
*   **`GetSourceMetadataAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Parses the `file://` URI, uses `FileInfo` to get the `Name`, `Length`, and `LastWriteTimeUtc`. Wraps in `Task.FromResult`.

## 4. `IOutputWriter` Implementation (`ConsoleOutputWriter`)

Uses standard .NET `System.IO` APIs for file writing and console APIs for display.

*   **`WriteOutputAsync(string personaId, string outputName, Stream contentStream, ...)`**:
    1.  Checks configuration for the designated output directory (e.g., `./.nucleus/console_outputs/`) and whether saving is enabled.
    2.  If enabled, constructs the full output path (e.g., `./.nucleus/console_outputs/{personaId}_{timestamp}_{outputName}`). Ensures the directory exists (`Directory.CreateDirectory`).
    3.  Uses `File.Create(path)` to get a `FileStream` and copies the `contentStream` into it asynchronously.
    4.  Returns the absolute `file://` URI of the created file.
    5.  Also prints a message to the console indicating the file was saved (e.g., "Output saved to: <path>").
*   **`WriteTextReplyAsync(string personaId, string replyContent, ...)`**:
    *   **Option 1 (Primary):** Writes the `replyContent` directly to the standard console output stream (e.g., using `Console.WriteLine` or `Spectre.Console`). Returns `null`.
    *   **Option 2 (If Saving Enabled):** In addition to console output, *may* also use `WriteOutputAsync` logic to save the `replyContent` as a file (e.g., `.txt` or `.md`) in the configured output directory. Returns the `file://` URI if saved.

# Teams Adapter: Interface Mapping

This document details the specific implementation patterns for the common client adapter interfaces defined in `../ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md` within the context of the [Microsoft Teams adapter (`Nucleus.Adapters.Teams`)](../ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTERS_TEAMS.md), leveraging the Bot Framework SDK and Microsoft Graph API.

## 1. `IPlatformMessage` Implementation

Corresponds primarily to a Bot Framework `Activity` object received by the bot.

*   **`MessageId`**: Maps to `Activity.Id`.
*   **`ConversationId`**: Maps to `Activity.Conversation.Id`. This could represent a channel (`teamsChannelId`), a group chat, or a 1:1 chat.
*   **`UserId`**: Maps to `Activity.From.AadObjectId`.
*   **`Content`**: Maps to `Activity.Text`. Mentions (`@NucleusPersonaName`) need to be stripped. If the activity represents a command (e.g., via Adaptive Card submission or specific text patterns), this content might need parsing.
*   **`Timestamp`**: Maps to `Activity.Timestamp` or `Activity.LocalTimestamp`.
*   **`SourceArtifactUris`**: Derived from `Activity.Attachments`.
    *   For file uploads (`application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.download.info`), the attachment's `contentUrl` might provide a short-lived download URL, but more robustly, metadata within the attachment or context allows constructing a **Microsoft Graph URI** pointing to the file in SharePoint (channel) or OneDrive (chat). This Graph URI (e.g., referencing DriveItem ID and path) is the preferred representation for persistence in `ArtifactMetadata`.
    *   For inline images or other content, appropriate identifiers/URIs are extracted.

## 2. `IPersonaInteractionContext` Implementation

Represents the scope of processing a specific `Activity` (or potentially a sequence related by `Activity.Conversation.Id` and `Activity.ReplyToId`). It's typically created within the bot's `OnTurnAsync` handler or a specific command handler.

*   **`InteractionId`**: A unique ID generated for this turn/interaction (e.g., `Guid.NewGuid().ToString()`). Could potentially incorporate `Activity.Id`.
*   **`UserId`**: Sourced from `Activity.From.AadObjectId`.
*   **`PlatformId`**: Hardcoded as `"Teams"`.
*   **`TriggeringMessages`**: Contains the `IPlatformMessage` wrapper(s) around the relevant `Activity` object(s).
*   **`SourceFileReader`**: An instance of a `TeamsSourceFileReader` (see below). Requires access to a `GraphServiceClient` authenticated for the user or the application, scoped appropriately based on the interaction context (channel/chat).
*   **`OutputWriter`**: An instance of a `TeamsOutputWriter` (see below). Also requires access to a `GraphServiceClient`.
*   **Disposal (`Dispose`)**: Should release any resources, potentially including cancelling long-running Graph API calls if applicable.
*   **Additional Capabilities**: Might hold references to the `ITurnContext` for sending replies (`TurnContext.SendActivityAsync`) or accessing bot-specific state/services.

## 3. `ISourceFileReader` Implementation (`TeamsSourceFileReader`)

Relies heavily on the Microsoft Graph API.

*   **`SourceExistsAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Uses `GraphServiceClient` to query Graph based on the `sourceUri` (which should be a Graph-compatible identifier like a DriveItem path or ID) to check for the item's existence and accessibility within the context's permissions.
*   **`OpenReadSourceAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Uses `GraphServiceClient.Drives[driveId].Items[itemId].Content.Request().GetAsync()` or similar Graph calls to download the file content as a `Stream`. Requires appropriate Graph permissions (`Files.Read`, `Sites.Read.All`, etc.).
*   **`GetSourceMetadataAsync(string sourceUri, ...)`**: Uses `GraphServiceClient` to retrieve the `DriveItem` metadata (name, size, lastModifiedDateTime, etc.) corresponding to the `sourceUri`.

## 4. `IOutputWriter` Implementation (`TeamsOutputWriter`)

Also relies on the Microsoft Graph API to write files back to the `.Nucleus` structure in the appropriate SharePoint site (Team default library) or potentially OneDrive for Business (less common for shared outputs).

*   **`WriteOutputAsync(string personaId, string outputName, Stream contentStream, ...)`**:
    1.  Determines the target SharePoint site/library based on the interaction context (e.g., `Activity.ChannelData.Team.Id`).
    2.  Constructs the target path within the `.Nucleus` structure (e.g., `/{TeamLibrary}/.Nucleus/Personas/{personaId}/GeneratedOutputs/{outputName}`).
    3.  Uses `GraphServiceClient.Drives[driveId].Root.ItemWithPath(path).Content.Request().PutAsync<DriveItem>(contentStream)` or similar Graph API calls to upload the file. Requires appropriate Graph permissions (`Files.ReadWrite`, `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, etc.).
    4.  Returns the Graph ID or persistent URL of the created `DriveItem`.
*   **`WriteTextReplyAsync(string personaId, string replyContent, ...)`**:
    *   **Option 1 (Primary):** Sends the `replyContent` back to the user via `ITurnContext.SendActivityAsync()`. This is the standard bot reply mechanism. Does *not* typically save a separate file for the chat message itself. Returns `null`.
    *   **Option 2 (If Explicit File Needed):** Could potentially use `WriteOutputAsync` to save the `replyContent` as a `.md` file (e.g., `chat_reply_{timestamp}.md`) in the `.Nucleus` output folder, in addition to sending it via `SendActivityAsync`. Returns the Graph ID/URL if saved. This might be useful for logging or complex replies.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Deployment Abstractions

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the fundamental, abstract components required to deploy and operate the Nucleus OmniRAG system. The goal is to define the necessary capabilities in a provider-agnostic way, allowing for flexibility in choosing deployment targets based on factors like cost, performance, existing infrastructure, or specific features.

While specific implementations will leverage provider-specific services (detailed in separate documents like [Azure Deployment](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_AZURE.md) and [Cloudflare Deployment](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_CLOUDFLARE.md)), understanding these core abstractions is crucial for maintaining architectural consistency and enabling potential portability.

## 2. Core Deployment Units

The Nucleus system fundamentally requires the following types of infrastructure components:

1.  **Containerized Compute Runtime:**
    *   **Requirement:** A platform capable of running the core .NET applications packaged as OCI-compliant containers (e.g., `Nucleus.Api`, background processors, future adapters).
    *   **Key Needs:** Scalability (manual or automatic), reliable execution, integration with networking and other services.
    *   **Examples:** Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, AWS ECS/EKS, Google Cloud Run/GKE, Cloudflare Workers (via Workers for Platforms or similar container support), Self-hosted Kubernetes/Docker.

2.  **Asynchronous Messaging (Pub/Sub):**
    *   **Purpose:** To decouple components, enable asynchronous processing, and reliably broadcast triggers (like new user interactions) to potentially multiple processing instances.
    *   **Abstraction:** A Publish/Subscribe messaging system consisting of:
        *   **Topics:** Named channels where messages (typically containing identifiers or minimal data) are published.
        *   **Subscriptions:** Each processing service instance (or logical group) creates its own subscription to relevant topics. The messaging system delivers a copy of each message published to the topic to every active subscription.
    *   **Key Capabilities:**
        *   Guaranteed delivery (at-least-once) per subscription.
        *   Message filtering capabilities (optional).
        *   Decoupling of publishers and subscribers.
        *   Support for competing consumers *within* a single subscription if needed for scaling internal processing.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Azure Service Bus Topics & Subscriptions
        *   Google Cloud Pub/Sub
        *   RabbitMQ (using Topic exchanges)
        *   NATS
        *   AWS SNS/SQS combination
    *   **Selection Criteria:** Reliability, scalability, cost, integration with the chosen compute runtime, latency requirements.

3.  **Document & Vector Database:**
    *   **Requirement:** A database solution capable of storing both structured/semi-structured metadata (`ArtifactMetadata`) and the derived knowledge (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`), including vector embeddings for semantic search.
    *   **Key Needs:** Scalability, efficient querying of structured data, efficient vector similarity search (ANN), flexible schema (for `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`), persistence, backup/recovery.
    *   **Examples:** Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API + Integrated Vector Search), PostgreSQL with `pgvector`, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, specialized vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus), Cloudflare Vectorize (for vectors) potentially paired with D1 or R2 (for structured/document data).

4.  **Object/Blob Storage:**
    *   **Requirement:** A scalable and durable storage service for holding original source artifacts (documents, images, etc.) uploaded by users.
    *   **Key Needs:** High durability, cost-effective storage, retrieval via API/SDK.
    *   **Examples:** Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Cloudflare R2.

## 3. External Dependencies

Beyond the core infrastructure, Nucleus relies on:

1.  **AI Services (LLM & Embeddings):**
    *   **Requirement:** Access to Large Language Models for generation/analysis and embedding models for vector creation.
    *   **Current Choice:** Google Gemini API.
    *   **Alternatives:** Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, local models (via Ollama etc. - requires significant compute).

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

Any deployment must also address:

*   **Networking & Security:** Secure communication between components, ingress control, potential VNet integration or private endpoints, firewalling.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Securely authenticating users and services.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Collecting logs, metrics, and traces for observability.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provisioning and managing infrastructure consistently (e.g., Bicep, Terraform, Pulumi).
*   **CI/CD:** Automating the build, test, and deployment process.

## 5. Provider Flexibility Considerations

Defining these abstractions allows for strategic choices:

*   **Azure:** Offers a mature, integrated ecosystem with services like ACA, Cosmos DB, and Service Bus providing a well-rounded PaaS solution.
*   **Cloudflare:** Presents a compelling alternative, particularly for cost-sensitive scenarios (e.g., education, prototypes) due to its generous free tiers and built-in security features (WAF, DDoS protection). Services like Workers, Queues, and Vectorize map well to the core needs, though the document database aspect requires careful consideration (e.g., pairing Vectorize with D1 or R2).

Detailed provider-specific architectures should reference these abstractions.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: CI/CD Strategy (Open Source Context)

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document details the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) strategy for the Nucleus OmniRAG project. As an open-source project, the focus of CI/CD is less on deploying to a specific production environment and more on:

*   **Validating Code Quality:** Ensuring code builds, passes tests, and adheres to standards.
*   **Creating Consumable Artifacts:** Building versioned Docker images and potentially example deployment configurations (like `docker-compose.yml` files) that users can easily deploy in their own environments ([Azure](./Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_AZURE.md), [Cloudflare](./Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_CLOUDFLARE.md), [Self-Hosted](./Hosting/ARCHITECTURE_HOSTING_SELFHOST_HOMENETWORK.md)).
*   **Automating Releases:** Streamlining the process of creating tagged releases with associated artifacts.
*   **Maintaining Security:** Ensuring the CI/CD process itself is secure and does not expose credentials or sensitive information.

## 2. Platform and Tooling

*   **CI/CD Platform:** **GitHub Actions** - Chosen due to its tight integration with GitHub repositories, generous free tier for public repositories, and extensive marketplace of actions.
*   **Container Registry:** **GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)** or **Docker Hub** - For hosting the publicly accessible, versioned Docker images of Nucleus components (`Nucleus.Api`, workers, etc.).
*   **Code Scanning/SAST (Optional):** GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL), SonarCloud - For identifying potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
*   **Container Scanning (Optional):** Trivy, Snyk, Dependabot - For scanning Docker images for known vulnerabilities in base images or dependencies.

## 3. Workflow Triggers

CI/CD workflows will be triggered by:

1.  **Pull Requests:** On pushes to branches associated with open pull requests targeting `main` (or other protected branches). Runs build, test, and linting stages.
2.  **Pushes to `main`:** After a PR is merged. Runs build, test, linting, and potentially builds a `-dev` or `-latest` tagged Docker image.
3.  **Git Tags (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`):** When a version tag is pushed. Runs build, test, linting, builds versioned Docker images (`X.Y.Z`), pushes images to the public registry, and creates a GitHub Release with release notes and potentially packaged example deployment files.

## 4. Key CI/CD Stages

A typical workflow (especially for PRs and `main` branch pushes) would include:

1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the latest source code.
2.  **Setup .NET:** Install the required .NET SDK version.
3.  **Restore Dependencies:** Run `dotnet restore`.
4.  **Build:** Run `dotnet build` for all relevant projects.
5.  **Linting/Formatting Check (Optional):** Run tools like `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`.
6.  **Unit Tests:** Run `dotnet test` for unit test projects.
7.  **Integration Tests (Conditional/Optional):** Run integration tests. This might require spinning up temporary services (e.g., using `docker-compose` within the action or service containers) for dependencies like databases or queues. Requires careful design to run efficiently and reliably in a CI environment.
8.  **Static Analysis (Optional):** Run CodeQL or other SAST tools.

**Release Workflow (Triggered by Git Tag):**

Includes all stages above, plus:

9.  **Build Docker Images:** Build Docker images for `Nucleus.Api`, workers, etc., using the Git tag as the image tag (e.g., `ghcr.io/your-org/nucleus-api:v1.0.0`).
10. **Log in to Container Registry:** Authenticate using a short-lived GitHub token or a dedicated secret.
11. **Push Docker Images:** Push the tagged images to the public registry.
12. **Container Vulnerability Scan (Optional):** Run Trivy/Snyk against the built images.
13. **Package Release Artifacts (Optional):** Create a zip file containing example `docker-compose.yml`, Helm charts, or configuration templates corresponding to the release version.
14. **Create GitHub Release:** Automatically create a GitHub Release associated with the Git tag, uploading any packaged artifacts and potentially auto-generating release notes.

## 5. Versioning Strategy

*   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0):** Adhere to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning.
*   **Tags Drive Releases:** Official releases correspond directly to Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`).
*   **Docker Image Tags:** Docker images will be tagged with the corresponding SemVer tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and potentially a floating tag like `latest` or `stable` (use floating tags with caution).

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Secrets Management:** **NEVER** commit secrets (API keys, registry passwords) directly into the repository. Use **GitHub Encrypted Secrets** for storing credentials needed by workflows (e.g., container registry login).
*   **Permissions:** Configure GitHub Actions workflows with the minimum necessary permissions. Use short-lived tokens where possible.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize Dependabot or similar tools to monitor dependencies (.NET packages, base Docker images) for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Log Sanitization:** Ensure no sensitive information is accidentally printed to workflow logs.
*   **Third-Party Actions:** Be cautious when using third-party GitHub Actions. Prefer official actions (e.g., `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-dotnet`) or actions from reputable sources. Pin actions to specific commit SHAs for security and stability.

## 7. Consumable Artifacts

The primary outputs of the CD process for consumers will be:

*   **Versioned Docker Images:** Available on GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub.
*   **Example Deployment Files (Optional):** Versioned `docker-compose.yml` files or potentially Helm charts attached to GitHub Releases, demonstrating how to run the Nucleus components together for different scenarios (e.g., self-hosting).

This CI/CD strategy aims to provide confidence in code quality and streamline the release process, making it easier for users to adopt and deploy Nucleus OmniRAG in their chosen environments.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Azure Deployment Strategy

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the recommended architecture for deploying the Nucleus OmniRAG system using Microsoft Azure services. It builds upon the [Deployment Abstractions](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md) and refines the concepts initially outlined in the [Overall Deployment Architecture](../07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Goal:** Leverage Azure's PaaS offerings for scalability, manageability, and integration while using Google Gemini for AI services.

## 2. Core Azure Service Mapping

Based on the [Deployment Abstractions](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md), the following Azure services are chosen:

1.  **Containerized Compute Runtime:**
    *   **Service:** **Azure Container Apps (ACA)**
    *   **Rationale:** Serverless container orchestration providing auto-scaling (including scale-to-zero), simplified networking (managed environment), built-in Dapr integration (optional but useful), and HTTPS ingress.
    *   **Components Hosted:**
        *   `Nucleus.Api` (Primary web API)
        *   Background processing workers (consuming from queues)
        *   Future platform adapters (e.g., Teams Bot backend)
    *   **Alternative:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Provides more control but significantly increases management overhead.

2.  **Asynchronous Messaging Queue:**
    *   **Service:** **Azure Service Bus (Standard Tier or higher)**
    *   **Rationale:** Reliable enterprise messaging with features like topics/subscriptions (future flexibility), dead-lettering, and ordering guarantees if needed. Integrates well with ACA (e.g., via KEDA scaler or Dapr pub/sub).
    *   **Usage:** Primarily for decoupling the ingestion pipeline stages ([Architecture - Processing](../01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md)).
    *   **Alternative:** Azure Storage Queues - Simpler and cheaper, but fewer features.

3.  **Document & Vector Database:**
    *   **Service:** **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API)**
    *   **Rationale:** Globally distributed, multi-model database with flexible schema, ideal for storing `ArtifactMetadata` and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`. Offers integrated vector search capabilities (currently in preview but expected GA), eliminating the need for a separate vector database.
    *   **Usage:** Storing structured/semi-structured metadata and derived knowledge including vector embeddings.
    *   **Alternative:** Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server with `pgvector` - Viable, but requires managing relational schema and scaling more explicitly.

4.  **Object/Blob Storage:**
    *   **Service:** **Azure Blob Storage (Standard Tier)**
    *   **Rationale:** Cost-effective, highly durable storage for source artifacts. Standard choice for unstructured data on Azure.
    *   **Usage:** Storing original user-uploaded files.

## 3. External Dependencies

*   **AI Services (LLM & Embeddings):**
    *   **Provider:** **Google Gemini API**
    *   **Integration:** Direct API calls from ACA compute instances to the Google Cloud APIs.
    *   **Consideration:** Network latency between Azure and Google Cloud. Ensure secure handling of Google API keys/credentials (e.g., via Azure Key Vault).

## 4. Networking and Security

*   **ACA Environment:** Deploy within an ACA Environment, potentially linked to a Virtual Network for enhanced security and control if needed (e.g., using Private Endpoints for Service Bus, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage).
*   **Ingress:** Managed HTTPS ingress provided by ACA.
*   **Secrets Management:** Utilize **Azure Key Vault** for storing connection strings, API keys (including Google Gemini keys), and other secrets. Access Key Vault using Managed Identities from ACA.
*   **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication, likely using Azure AD (Entra ID) for user and potentially service principal authentication ([Architecture - Security](../06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md)).

## 5. Monitoring and Observability

*   **Service:** **Azure Monitor (Application Insights)**
    *   **Rationale:** Integrated monitoring solution for collecting logs, metrics, and traces from ACA, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, etc.
    *   **Usage:** Application performance monitoring (APM), log analytics, alerting.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Tool:** **Bicep** or **Terraform**
    *   **Rationale:** Define and deploy Azure resources consistently and repeatably.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use Bicep for Azure-native focus, Terraform for potential multi-cloud scenarios (though this document focuses on Azure).

## 7. CI/CD

*   **Platform:** **Azure DevOps Pipelines** or **GitHub Actions**
    *   **Workflow:** Build container images, push to Azure Container Registry (ACR), deploy to Azure Container Apps.

## 8. Considerations Summary

*   **Cost:** Primarily driven by ACA compute hours, Cosmos DB RU/s and storage, Service Bus operations, and Blob Storage volume/transactions. Utilize scaling features (especially scale-to-zero for ACA) to manage costs.
*   **Latency:** Potential latency for calls to Google Gemini APIs from Azure infrastructure.
*   **Vendor Lock-in:** While using PaaS services increases efficiency, it creates dependence on Azure. The abstract design aims to mitigate this conceptually.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Cloudflare Deployment Strategy

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document explores a potential architecture for deploying the Nucleus OmniRAG system leveraging Cloudflare's developer platform. This strategy is particularly attractive for scenarios prioritizing cost-efficiency (generous free tiers), simplified security management, and global performance via Cloudflare's edge network.

It builds upon the [Deployment Abstractions](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md) and offers an alternative to the [Azure Deployment Strategy](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_AZURE.md).

**Goal:** Utilize Cloudflare's integrated platform for compute, storage, messaging, and vector search, potentially minimizing infrastructure costs and complexity, while using Google Gemini for core AI services.

## 2. Core Cloudflare Service Mapping

Based on the [Deployment Abstractions](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md), the following Cloudflare services are proposed:

1.  **Containerized Compute Runtime:**
    *   **Service:** **Cloudflare Workers** (Potentially using Workers for Platforms for container support, or refactoring core logic into Worker scripts)
    *   **Rationale:** Serverless compute at the edge, extremely cost-effective (generous free tier), globally distributed. Running .NET applications might require container support or significant refactoring to fit the Worker model (JavaScript/Wasm).
    *   **Components Hosted:**
        *   `Nucleus.Api` equivalent (as a Worker or container)
        *   Background processing logic (as Workers triggered by Queues)
        *   Future platform adapters

2.  **Asynchronous Messaging Queue:**
    *   **Service:** **Cloudflare Queues**
    *   **Rationale:** Simple, reliable queuing service integrated with Workers. Supports batching and has a generous free tier.
    *   **Usage:** Decoupling ingestion pipeline stages, triggering background Worker processing.

3.  **Document & Vector Database:**
    *   **Service:** **Cloudflare Vectorize** (for vectors) + **Cloudflare D1** or **R2** (for structured/document data)
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   `Vectorize`: Purpose-built, globally distributed vector database integrated with Workers, offering a free tier.
        *   `D1`: SQL database based on SQLite. Could store `ArtifactMetadata` and potentially serialized `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` JSON. Free tier available, but relational nature might be less flexible than NoSQL.
        *   `R2`: S3-compatible object storage. Could store `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` as JSON blobs alongside vectors in `Vectorize`, potentially indexed by `ArtifactMetadata` in D1. Querying structured data within blobs would be less efficient than D1 or a true document DB.
    *   **Usage:** `Vectorize` for semantic search vectors. `D1` or `R2` (or a combination) for storing `ArtifactMetadata` and the structured parts of `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`. This requires careful design to ensure efficient lookups and joins between vector results and associated metadata.
    *   **Challenge:** No single Cloudflare service perfectly maps to a flexible document database *with* integrated vector search like Cosmos DB. Requires composing services.

4.  **Object/Blob Storage:**
    *   **Service:** **Cloudflare R2**
    *   **Rationale:** S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees (significant cost advantage compared to AWS S3/Azure Blob), globally distributed, generous free tier.
    *   **Usage:** Storing original user-uploaded files.

## 3. External Dependencies

*   **AI Services (LLM & Embeddings):**
    *   **Provider:** **Google Gemini API**
    *   **Integration:** Direct API calls from Cloudflare Workers to the Google Cloud APIs.
    *   **Consideration:** Network latency between Cloudflare's edge and Google Cloud. Secure handling of Google API keys/credentials (using Worker secrets).

## 4. Networking and Security

*   **Built-in Security:** Cloudflare platform inherently provides DDoS mitigation, WAF (configurable), TLS encryption.
*   **Secrets Management:** Cloudflare Workers support encrypted environment variables (secrets) for storing API keys (e.g., Google Gemini keys).
*   **Authentication:** Can leverage Cloudflare Access for user authentication, or implement custom JWT/other schemes within Workers.

## 5. Monitoring and Observability

*   **Built-in Analytics:** Cloudflare provides analytics for Workers, Queues, R2, etc.
*   **Logging:** Workers support `console.log` which can be viewed in the dashboard or potentially shipped to third-party logging services.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Supported via integrations.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Tool:** **Terraform** or **Cloudflare Wrangler CLI**
    *   **Rationale:** Terraform has a Cloudflare provider. Wrangler is the native CLI tool for managing Cloudflare developer resources.

## 7. CI/CD

*   **Platform:** **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, etc.
    *   **Workflow:** Build/bundle Worker code (and potentially containers), deploy using Wrangler CLI or Terraform.

## 8. Considerations Summary

*   **Cost:** Potentially very low or free for moderate usage due to Cloudflare's generous free tiers, especially R2's zero egress fees.
*   **Performance:** Global distribution via Cloudflare's edge network can offer low latency for users worldwide.
*   **Developer Experience:** Running .NET natively might require container support on Workers or refactoring. The database solution requires careful composition of Vectorize + D1/R2.
*   **Maturity:** Some Cloudflare developer services (like Vectorize, D1) are newer compared to established Azure/AWS counterparts, though evolving rapidly.
*   **Security:** Simplified security management due to built-in features is a major advantage.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Self-Hosted Home Network Deployment Strategy

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and considerations for deploying the Nucleus OmniRAG system within a home network environment, primarily targeting individual users or developers who wish to run the system locally on their own hardware. This approach leverages Docker Desktop (or a similar containerization platform) for packaging and running the necessary components.

**Goal:** Provide a self-contained Nucleus instance accessible within the user's home network, minimizing reliance on cloud services for core infrastructure while still potentially using cloud AI providers.

## 2. Feasibility Assessment

Self-hosting Nucleus on a home network is generally **feasible**, especially for access *within* the local network. Key considerations include:

*   **Outbound Connectivity:** Required for the Nucleus API/Workers to reach external services like the Google Gemini API. Standard home internet connections usually permit this.
*   **Inbound Connectivity (Local):** Accessing the Nucleus API from other devices *on the same home network* is straightforward (using the host machine's local IP address and the mapped port).
*   **Inbound Connectivity (External - Optional/Complex):** Allowing access from *outside* the home network (e.g., for a Teams bot webhook) is more complex and introduces security risks. It typically requires:
    *   **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** To handle the changing public IP address assigned by most ISPs.
    *   **Port Forwarding:** Configuring the home router to forward specific external ports to the internal IP address and port of the machine hosting Nucleus.
    *   **Security:** Exposing services directly from a home network significantly increases the attack surface. Proper firewall rules, HTTPS with valid certificates (e.g., via Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge), and potentially reverse proxies (like Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager running in Docker) are highly recommended.
    *   **ISP Terms:** Some ISPs prohibit hosting servers on residential connections.
*   **Hardware Resources:** Requires a reasonably powerful host machine (CPU, ample RAM, sufficient disk space) to run Docker Desktop and multiple containers concurrently (API, database, queue, potentially workers).

## 3. Core Component Mapping (Docker Containers)

Based on the [Deployment Abstractions](./ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md), the system can be run using standard Docker containers:

1.  **Containerized Compute Runtime:**
    *   **Technology:** **Docker Desktop** (Windows, macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux).
    *   **Components:**
        *   Custom-built Docker images for `Nucleus.Api`, background workers, etc., based on the .NET SDK/runtime base images.
        *   Orchestration via `docker-compose.yml` for defining and linking services.

2.  **Asynchronous Messaging Queue:**
    *   **Technology:** **Official RabbitMQ Docker Image** or **NATS Docker Image**.
    *   **Rationale:** Widely used, reliable open-source message brokers available as ready-to-run containers.
    *   **Configuration:** Define as a service in `docker-compose.yml`, configure Nucleus apps to connect to the container's service name on the Docker network.

3.  **Document & Vector Database:**
    *   **Technology:** **Official PostgreSQL Docker Image** + **`pgvector` extension** (requires a compatible image or adding the extension).
    *   **Rationale:** Robust open-source relational database with a mature vector search extension. Feasible to run in a container.
    *   **Configuration:** Define as a service in `docker-compose.yml`, configure persistent volume mapping for data durability, set up user/database, install `pgvector` extension.
    *   **Alternative:** Running other vector databases like Qdrant or Weaviate as separate containers.

4.  **Object/Blob Storage:**
    *   **Technology:** **Docker Volume Mounts** or **MinIO Docker Image**.
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   *Volume Mounts:* Simplest approach for local files. Map a host directory into the API/worker containers for storing source artifacts. Less scalable, data tied to the host filesystem.
        *   *MinIO:* S3-compatible object storage server available as a Docker container. Provides an API similar to cloud storage, better separation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Start with volume mounts for simplicity, consider MinIO if S3 compatibility is desired locally.

## 4. External Dependencies

*   **AI Services (LLM & Embeddings):**
    *   **Provider:** **Google Gemini API** (or others like Azure OpenAI, local models via Ollama container).
    *   **Integration:** Outbound API calls from Nucleus containers. Requires host machine to have internet access.
    *   **Credentials:** Pass API keys securely via Docker secrets or environment variables managed through `docker-compose.yml`.

## 5. Networking Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)

*   **Docker Network:** Define a custom bridge network for all Nucleus services to communicate via service names.
*   **Port Mapping:** Expose the `Nucleus.Api` container's port to a port on the host machine (e.g., map host `5000` to container `8080`).
*   **Access:** Other devices on the home network access the API via `http://<host-machine-local-ip>:<mapped-host-port>`.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Local Access:** Generally safe within a trusted home network, but be mindful of who has access.
*   **External Access:** High risk. Requires careful configuration of firewalls, HTTPS, authentication, and understanding the implications of exposing your home network.
*   **Secrets:** Avoid hardcoding secrets. Use Docker secrets or environment variables (potentially loaded from a `.env` file excluded from source control).

## 7. Setup and Management

*   **`docker-compose.yml`:** The central piece for defining services, networks, volumes, and environment variables.
*   **Building Images:** Requires Dockerfiles for each custom .NET application (`Nucleus.Api`, workers).
*   **Running:** Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
*   **Maintenance:** Requires managing Docker (updates, resource usage), container images, persistent data volumes, and backups.

## 8. Summary

Self-hosting Nucleus on a home network via Docker is viable and provides maximum data privacy and control for local use. It requires technical proficiency with Docker, managing different containerized services, and understanding basic home networking. While outbound connections (for AI APIs) are easy, enabling reliable and secure *inbound* access from the internet poses significant challenges and security risks that users must carefully consider and mitigate.

title: Persona - Bootstrapper
description: Describes the basic Bootstrapper persona for Nucleus OmniRAG, serving as a foundation or fallback.
version: 0.1
date: 2025-05-17
---

# Persona: Bootstrapper

## 1. Purpose

The Bootstrapper persona represents the most fundamental level of interaction within the Nucleus OmniRAG system. It is designed to be simple and serve potentially as:

*   **Initial Setup/Testing:** Provides a basic interaction layer for verifying core system functionality (ingestion, storage, basic retrieval) without complex domain logic.
*   **Fallback Behavior:** Could act as a default persona if a more specialized one is not specified or applicable.
*   **Foundation:** Represents the core `IPersona` implementation from which more complex personas can inherit or delegate.

It typically involves minimal analysis during ingestion and focuses on direct retrieval or simple query handling.

## 2. Typical Request Flow (Simple Query)

**Purpose:** Illustrates a basic query flow with minimal processing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UserInterface as User Interface
    participant QueryAPI as Nucleus Query API
    participant BootstrapperPersona as Bootstrapper Persona Module
    participant KnowledgeDB as Cosmos DB (ArtifactMetadata & Minimal PKEs)
    participant AIService as AI Model (Optional)

    UserInterface->>+QueryAPI: Sends Basic Query
    QueryAPI->>+BootstrapperPersona: Handle Query Request
    BootstrapperPersona->>+KnowledgeDB: Retrieve Relevant ArtifactMetadata or simple PKEs
    KnowledgeDB-->>-BootstrapperPersona: Return Basic Data/Text Snippets
    %% Optional: Simple AI summarization/formatting %%
    BootstrapperPersona->>+AIService: (Optional) Format/Summarize Snippets
    AIService-->>-BootstrapperPersona: Formatted Response
    BootstrapperPersona-->>-QueryAPI: Return Response
    QueryAPI-->>-UserInterface: Display Response

```

**Explanation:** A user sends a simple query. The Bootstrapper persona directly retrieves potentially relevant metadata or very basic stored knowledge entries (perhaps just text snippets). It might perform minimal formatting, possibly using an AI service, before returning the result. Deep analysis or complex synthesis is generally avoided.

## 3. Key Characteristics

*   **Simplicity:** Minimal domain logic and analysis.
*   **Directness:** Focuses on basic retrieval and interaction.
*   **Foundation:** Implements the core `IPersona` contract.
*   **Low Overhead:** Requires minimal configuration and processing resources compared to specialized personas.

# Persona: Educator ('EduFlow OmniEducator')

## 1. Vision & Purpose

The Educator persona, initially conceived as EduFlow OmniEducator, is the flagship persona for Nucleus OmniRAG. It stems from the need to create a safer, more personalized, and authentic educational experience, particularly recognizing learning within digital creation and self-directed projects. Traditional educational models often fail to capture or support this intrinsic drive.

This persona aims to:

*   **Observe Authenticity:** Capture and understand learning as it happens naturally (e.g., coding projects, game modding, digital art).
*   **Document Process:** Analyze *how* learning occurs (capabilities, processes, cognitive depth) using its "Learning Facets" schema, alongside *what* subjects are touched upon.
*   **Build Understanding:** Create a dynamic, private knowledge base for each learner, mapping their unique trajectory.
*   **Provide Insight:** Enable querying of this knowledge base for meaningful progress reports and contextually relevant support.
*   **Foster Engagement:** Potentially leverage Nucleus capabilities (like dynamic content generation via tools) to create tailored micro-learning experiences.

It transforms ephemeral moments of creation into tangible evidence of learning, supporting learners, educators, and parents.

## 2. Typical Request Flow (Learning Artifact Analysis - Slow Path)

**Purpose:** Illustrates the asynchronous analysis of a submitted learning artifact (e.g., a screen recording of a coding session).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LearnerApp as Learner Interface / App
    participant ACA_Instance as Azure Container App Instance (API / Ingestion / Processing)
    participant TempStorage as Temporary Raw Data Storage
    participant KnowledgeDB as Cosmos DB (IngestionRecord, ArtifactMetadata & PersonaKnowledgeEntries)
    participant EducatorPersona as Educator Persona Module (within ACA)
    participant AIService as AI Model (e.g., Google Gemini)

    LearnerApp->>+ACA_Instance: Submits Artifact (API Request)
    activate ACA_Instance
    ACA_Instance->>ACA_Instance: Establish Session Context (In-Memory)
    ACA_Instance->>+TempStorage: Store Raw Artifact (gets Temp Pointer)
    ACA_Instance->>+KnowledgeDB: Create IngestionRecord (IngestionID, SourceType, Temp Pointer)
    ACA_Instance->>ACA_Instance: Schedule Background Task (IngestionID, Session Context Ref)
    ACA_Instance-->>-LearnerApp: Return API Response (e.g., Accepted 202)
    deactivate ACA_Instance

    %% --- Background Task Execution --- %%
    activate ACA_Instance #LightSkyBlue
    ACA_Instance->>+KnowledgeDB: Read IngestionRecord (using IngestionID)
    ACA_Instance->>+TempStorage: Fetch Raw Artifact Data (using Temp Pointer)
    ACA_Instance->>+KnowledgeDB: Create/Update ArtifactMetadata (Initial - Status: Processing)
    ACA_Instance->>+EducatorPersona: Initiate Analysis (Salience Check, pass Raw Data/Metadata/Context)
    Note right of EducatorPersona: Persona determines if artifact is relevant based on data and session context.
    EducatorPersona-->>-ACA_Instance: Confirms Salience
    ACA_Instance->>+EducatorPersona: Process Artifact (Extract Text/Features, Use AI)
    EducatorPersona->>+AIService: Analyze Content (Apply Learning Facets, Identify Skills/Domains)
    AIService-->>-EducatorPersona: Return Analysis Results (Structured Data)
    EducatorPersona-->>-ACA_Instance: Return Derived Knowledge (e.g., LearningEvidenceAnalysis)
    ACA_Instance->>+AIService: Generate Embeddings for Key Snippets/Analysis
    AIService-->>-ACA_Instance: Return Embeddings
    ACA_Instance->>+KnowledgeDB: Write PersonaKnowledgeEntry (Analysis, Embeddings)
    ACA_Instance->>+KnowledgeDB: Update ArtifactMetadata (Processing Complete)
    ACA_Instance->>-TempStorage: Delete Raw Artifact Data
    deactivate ACA_Instance #LightSkyBlue

    %% Optional Notification Back to Learner App can be added here (e.g., via SignalR/WebSockets) %%
```

**Explanation:** A learner submits an artifact via an API call to the main Azure Container App (ACA) instance. The ACA handler establishes session context, creates an Ingestion Record, stores raw data temporarily, and schedules an in-process background task. The API responds quickly. The background task then executes within the same ACA instance, fetches the raw data using the Ingestion ID, accesses session context if needed, and invokes the Educator Persona. The Persona checks relevance (salience) and, if salient, orchestrates the analysis using AI services (like Gemini). The derived knowledge and embeddings are stored as a `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` in Cosmos DB. Finally, temporary data is cleaned up.

## 3. Interaction Example (Query - Fast Path)

(To be defined - would show querying the KnowledgeDB for insights about learner progress based on analyzed artifacts).

## Knowledge Framework: Pedagogical and Tautological Trees

The Educator persona operates with a sophisticated understanding of child development and learning, codified within two distinct knowledge frameworks:

1.  **Pedagogical Tree:** Maps learning activities and artifacts to specific subject domains and genuine skill acquisition (e.g., mastering algebraic concepts, understanding historical timelines, developing artistic techniques).
2.  **Tautological Tree:** Maps the same activities to underlying cognitive, social-emotional, and physical developmental processes (e.g., logical reasoning, collaborative problem-solving, fine motor control), often aligning with formal educational standards or reporting requirements.

This dual-lens approach allows the Educator to analyze learning comprehensively, supporting authentic skill development while also facilitating necessary documentation and reporting.

    KnowledgeDB-->>-BackendAPI: Return Relevant Entries (Ranked Structured Data, Snippets, Vectors)
    Note right of BackendAPI: Entries contain structured data (Problem, Solution Snippet, KB Link) + Vectors + Source Identifiers
    BackendAPI->>+AIService: Synthesize Response using Retrieved Entries/Snippets
    AIService-->>-BackendAPI: Generated Response Text
    BackendAPI-->>-TeamsAdapter: Return Synthesized Response

    %% --- Response Delivery --- %%
    TeamsAdapter->>+BotFramework: Post Response Message
    BotFramework->>+TeamsClient: Display Response in Teams
    TeamsClient-->>-ITStaff: Shows retrieved solution steps, KB links, related ticket refs

```

**Explanation:** This sequence shows a query originating from an IT staff member in Teams. The message flows through the Bot Framework to the Nucleus Teams Adapter. The adapter forwards the query to the backend API/handler. The backend generates a vector embedding for the query, searches the `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` data in Cosmos DB using the embedding and any relevant filters (like detected error codes), retrieves the most relevant derived knowledge (structured data, snippets, vectors), and uses the AI service to synthesize a user-friendly response based on those retrieved items. The response is then sent back through the layers to the user in Teams.

# Educator Persona Knowledge Trees

## Overview

The Educator persona utilizes a dual knowledge framework represented by two distinct but complementary tree structures: the Pedagogical Tree and the Tautological Tree. This framework allows the persona to analyze learning artifacts and activities through two lenses:

1.  **The Pedagogical Lens:** Focuses on the development of genuine skills, subject matter knowledge, and conceptual understanding within specific educational domains (e.g., Literacy, Numeracy, Science, Arts). It represents *what* the child is learning in terms of curriculum-aligned or real-world capabilities.

2.  **The Tautological Lens:** Focuses on the underlying cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and creative *processes* being developed and demonstrated. It captures *how* the child is learning and developing foundational abilities (e.g., Symbolic Reasoning, Pattern Recognition, Collaboration, Fine Motor Control), often aligning with developmental psychology milestones or formal reporting requirements mandated by educational systems.

## Purpose and Application

The Educator persona uses these trees to:

*   **Analyze Learning Artifacts:** Evaluate submitted work (like projects, observations, or interactions with educational tools like the [Numeracy and Timelines Web App Concept](./NumeracyAndTimelinesWebappConcept.md)) to identify evidence of skills and processes defined in the trees.
*   **Map Progress:** Connect observed activities and achievements to specific nodes in both trees, providing a comprehensive view of development.
*   **Identify Gaps:** Recognize areas where a learner might need more support or exposure.
*   **Facilitate Reporting:** Translate authentic learning experiences (captured via the Pedagogical Tree) into the language of formal requirements (often reflected in the Tautological Tree), aiding in documentation for homeschooling portfolios or institutional reporting.
*   **Generate Insights:** Potentially create visualizations or summaries (similar in concept to the [DATAVIZ Processor](../../Processors/ARCHITECTURE_DATAVIZ_TEMPLATE.md)) showing progress across different domains and processes over time.

## Age-Specific Breakdowns

The detailed, age-specific definitions for both the Pedagogical and Tautological Trees, covering expected capabilities from approximately Age 5 through Age 18, are maintained in the following sub-directory:

*   [`./Pedagogical_And_Tautological_Trees_Of_Knowledge/`](./Pedagogical_And_Tautological_Trees_Of_Knowledge/)

Each file within this directory (e.g., `Age05.md`, `Age10.md`) contains the specific tree structures relevant to the capabilities typically expected by the end of that year.

# Reference Implementation: Educator Persona

This document outlines conceptual architecture, data flow, and key models for implementing the Educator (EduFlow OmniEducator) persona, as described in the main [Educator Persona Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS_EDUCATOR.md).

## 1. High-Level Component Architecture (Conceptual)

**Purpose:** Shows the interaction of components specifically focused on the Educator persona's functions, assuming deployment within a cloud environment (e.g., Azure).

    Config -- Manages Settings --> EducatorModule
    Config -- Manages Settings --> AI_SVC
```

**Explanation:** User interactions (submitting artifacts or querying) go through dedicated APIs. Artifact ingestion triggers asynchronous processing via a **messaging service (Pub/Sub Topic)**. The Processing Service coordinates with the Educator Persona Module, which utilizes AI services, internal schemas (Learning Facets), and potentially external standards databases to analyze content. Results (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) are stored in Cosmos DB. Queries are handled more directly, retrieving stored knowledge and synthesizing answers.

## 2. Core Data Model Summary

This persona relies heavily on structured data captured during the 'slow path' analysis, stored as `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` documents. These entries link back to the source `ArtifactMetadata` and reference conceptual models like:

*   **`LearnerProfile`**: Represents the individual learner.
*   **`Goal`**: Tracks learning objectives.
*   **`LearningActivity` / `Project`**: Describes the context of artifact creation.
*   **`LearningArtifact` / `LearningEvidence`**: (Stored as `ArtifactMetadata`) The source material.
*   **`KnowledgeDomain`**: Classifies content using both Pedagogical Subjects (e.g., Math, Art) and Foundational Capabilities (e.g., Critical Thinking, Problem Solving).
*   **`Skill`**: Specific abilities demonstrated within domains.

**Key `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` Fields (Conceptual for Educator):**

*   `artifactId` (Link to `ArtifactMetadata`)
*   `learnerId`
*   `analysisTimestamp`
*   `analysisType`: "LearningEvidenceAnalysis"
*   `summary`: AI-generated summary of the artifact's educational relevance.
*   `identifiedDomains`: List<[`KnowledgeDomain.domain_id`, confidence_score]>
*   `identifiedSkills`: List<[`Skill.skill_id`, confidence_score, evidence_snippet]>
*   `learningFacetsAnalysis`: JSON object detailing observations based on the Facets schema (e.g., { "problemSolving": { "level": "Applied", "evidence": "..." }, ... })
*   `standardMappings`: List<[`Standard.standard_id`, relevance_score]>
*   `vectorEmbeddings`: List<{ `snippet`: string, `embedding`: float[] }>

**Explanation:** The Educator persona prioritizes capturing learning from authentic activities, analyzing it through multiple lenses (subject matter and cognitive processes), storing this rich data securely per learner, and enabling powerful querying for insights. Its design emphasizes privacy and adaptability.

## 4. Potential Future Extensions

*   **Interactive Learning Tools:** Leverage Nucleus's ability to execute tools (e.g., `PROCESSING_DATAVIZ`) to create small, tailored learning games or exercises dynamically.
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Based on analyzed progress, suggest related activities or areas for exploration.
*   **Collaborative Features:** Allow sharing of progress or insights between learners, parents, and educators (with explicit consent).
*   **Advanced Standards Alignment:** Deeper integration with specific curriculum standards databases.

# **Conceptual Plan and Feasibility Analysis: AI-Driven Numeracy and Timeline Web Application for Young Children**

## **1\. Introduction**

**1.1. Purpose**

This report outlines a conceptual plan and feasibility analysis for an innovative web-based educational application, aligning with the goals of the [Educator Persona Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS_EDUCATOR.md). The primary objective of this application is to teach fundamental numeracy concepts (specifically base-10 understanding and magnitude comparison) and the concept of timelines (including historical and potentially cosmological scales) to pre-literate children, typically within the age range of 3 to 6 years. The technical approach utilizes a delivery mechanism for self-contained interactive content similar to that described in the general [Data Visualization Overview](../../Processing/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md) and detailed in the [Dataviz Template](../../Processing/Dataviz/ARCHITECTURE_DATAVIZ_TEMPLATE.md). The plan details the proposed technology stack, architectural design, key feature implementations, AI-driven content generation strategies, deployment methods, and recommended development workflows.

**1.2. Application Vision**

The envisioned application will provide a highly interactive and visually engaging learning environment tailored to the cognitive development stage of young, pre-literate children. Core functionalities will include:

* **Interactive Numeracy Exercises:** Visually rich activities focusing on base-10 manipulation (e.g., grouping virtual blocks 1) and magnitude comparison (e.g., identifying larger/smaller groups visually 4). The emphasis will be on intuitive understanding derived from interaction rather than abstract symbols or text.6  
* **Infinite Zooming Timeline:** A dynamic timeline interface allowing seamless zooming across vast time scales, from personal events to historical periods and potentially deep time (geological, cosmological).11 Users, including children, will be able to place personal markers on the timeline.13

The pedagogical approach leverages principles of embodied cognition, suggesting that interaction and physical-like manipulation of virtual objects can enhance understanding of abstract concepts.6 The application aims to foster number sense 19 and an intuitive grasp of temporal scale through exploration and play.

**1.3. Key Technical Constraints & Goals**

The conceptual plan is shaped by several key technical requirements and objectives:

* **Browser-Based Technologies:** Primary reliance on standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and browser-based graphics APIs (WebGL, Canvas).22  
* **Low-End Hardware Compatibility:** Optimized performance for a wide range of devices, including low-specification computers, tablets, and notably, Smart TVs.24  
* **Tight Development Loops:** Utilization of tools and workflows that support rapid iteration and immediate feedback during development.26  
* **Broad Deployment:** Ability to deploy easily across platforms, with a focus on Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for installability and offline access.28  
* **AI-Driven Content Generation:** Significant reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to dynamically generate educational content, including animations, interactive scenarios, timeline data, and exercise parameters.30

The successful realization of this application hinges on effectively navigating the interplay between these constraints. Delivering rich, engaging interactivity suitable for pre-literate children 6 must be balanced against the stringent performance demands of low-end hardware.24 Furthermore, the AI content generation mechanisms must produce outputs that are not only pedagogically sound and age-appropriate but also optimized for efficient rendering within these technical limitations. This necessitates careful technology selection, prioritizing GPU acceleration for graphics 22 and favoring AI approaches that generate structured parameters over raw, potentially inefficient assets.36

## **2\. Technology Stack Analysis & Recommendations**

The selection of appropriate web technologies is critical to meeting the application's goals, particularly regarding performance on low-end devices, interactivity, and the integration of 3D elements and AI-generated content.

**2.1. Core Rendering Technologies Comparison (Canvas, SVG, WebGL)**

The core interactive elements – the timeline and numeracy exercises – require dynamic, potentially complex visualizations. The choice of rendering technology significantly impacts performance and capability.

* **DOM (Document Object Model):** While fundamental to web pages, direct DOM manipulation for complex graphics and frequent animations is generally inefficient.22 It struggles with large numbers of elements and real-time updates, making it unsuitable for the core visualizations required here, though acceptable for relatively static UI components like buttons or settings panels if used sparingly.  
* **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** SVG offers resolution-independent vector graphics, excellent for sharp lines and shapes at any scale, and integrates well with DOM events and CSS.22 However, its performance degrades significantly as the number of elements increases.35 Rendering thousands of markers on an infinite timeline or animating numerous objects in numeracy exercises could easily become a bottleneck, especially on low-end hardware.35 It might be considered for static overlays or simpler UI elements but is not recommended for the primary interactive canvases.  
* **Canvas API (2D Context):** The Canvas 2D API provides a pixel-based drawing surface controlled via JavaScript. It generally offers better performance than SVG for scenarios with many elements or frequent redraws.22 However, it lacks an inherent scene graph, requiring manual management of object states and redraw cycles. It's a viable option for 2D numeracy visualizations but cannot directly handle the 3D base-10 block requirement. Libraries like PixiJS often abstract the Canvas 2D API to provide higher-level features.40  
* **WebGL (Web Graphics Library):** WebGL provides direct access to the device's GPU for hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics rendering.22 This offers the highest potential performance, especially for complex scenes, large datasets (like the timeline), and 3D objects (like base-10 blocks).35 While more complex to use directly than the Canvas 2D API or SVG, libraries significantly simplify its use. Given the performance constraints and the 3D requirement, WebGL is the most suitable foundation.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize **WebGL** for rendering the core interactive components (timeline visualization, 3D numeracy exercises) due to its superior performance potential on constrained hardware and its native 3D capabilities.22 Minimize the use of DOM and SVG for performance-critical areas. If certain numeracy modules are strictly 2D and highly complex graphically, the Canvas 2D API (potentially via a library like PixiJS) could be an alternative, but WebGL remains the primary recommendation for consistency and handling 3D requirements.

The demanding nature of the infinite timeline and the need for smooth interaction on low-end devices like Smart TVs 24 strongly favors GPU acceleration. While WebGL introduces complexity, this is mitigated by using appropriate libraries, making it the necessary choice to meet performance goals.

**2.2. Rendering Libraries Comparison (Three.js vs. PixiJS)**

Directly programming WebGL is complex. High-level libraries abstract these complexities, providing scene graphs, object management, and easier APIs.

* **Three.js:** A mature and widely-used JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics using WebGL.42  
  * *Strengths:* Comprehensive feature set for 3D scenes (cameras, lights, materials, geometries), large community support, extensive documentation and examples 43, suitable for complex 3D interactions and visualizations.45 Capable of rendering 2D content via OrthographicCamera.42 Supports techniques for handling large datasets suitable for the timeline.41  
  * *Weaknesses:* Can be perceived as having a steeper learning curve than dedicated 2D libraries.43 Might be slightly less optimized for pure 2D sprite-based rendering compared to PixiJS.42  
  * *Suitability:* Excellent fit for the 3D base-10 manipulation exercises.45 Its robust WebGL foundation makes it highly suitable for the demanding infinite timeline visualization.  
* **PixiJS:** A high-performance 2D rendering library primarily focused on speed, utilizing WebGL with a Canvas fallback.40  
  * *Strengths:* Highly optimized for 2D rendering performance, especially sprites and simple graphics, through techniques like batching.40 Generally considered easier to learn for 2D tasks than Three.js.40 Good for games and interactive 2D content.40  
  * *Weaknesses:* Primarily focused on 2D; lacks built-in support for 3D scenes, lighting, or complex 3D geometries.40  
  * *Suitability:* Ideal for purely 2D numeracy exercises requiring high performance. Could potentially render the timeline if a 2D representation is sufficient, but direct WebGL control might be needed for advanced infinite zoom optimizations. Performance tuning guidance is available.48

**Recommendation:** Utilize **Three.js** as the primary rendering library. The explicit requirement for interactive 3D base-10 manipulation exercises 45 necessitates a 3D-capable library. Three.js is well-suited for this and possesses the underlying WebGL power to handle the performance demands of the infinite timeline visualization.41 While PixiJS offers excellent 2D performance 40, introducing a second rendering engine adds complexity. Three.js can effectively render the 2D timeline using an orthographic camera setup 42, providing a unified rendering approach.

The need for 3D visualization makes Three.js the logical cornerstone. Standardizing on one powerful library simplifies development, state management, and potential integration between the numeracy and timeline modules.

**2.3. Physics Libraries Comparison (Matter.js vs. Planck.js)**

For the "Line Rider-like" physics simulation requested for some scenarios, a lightweight 2D JavaScript physics engine is needed.

* **Matter.js:** A feature-rich 2D rigid body physics engine written natively in JavaScript.51  
  * *Strengths:* Comprehensive feature set (bodies, constraints, collisions, events, gravity) 51, designed for web integration, generally good documentation and examples 51, active community.52 Offers performance tuning parameters (e.g., delta, maxFrameTime, maxUpdates in Runner).53  
  * *Weaknesses:* Some benchmarks and user reports suggest potential performance issues compared to Box2D ports in specific scenarios 52, although recent versions may have improved.57 Stability concerns have been noted in specific interaction cases (e.g., objects passing through each other at high speed, mouse interactions).55  
  * *Suitability:* Well-suited for the relatively simple physics required (drawing lines, basic collisions, gravity). Its direct JS nature simplifies integration.  
* **Planck.js:** A JavaScript rewrite/port of the well-established Box2D physics engine.52  
  * *Strengths:* Benefits from the robustness and stability reputation of Box2D.52 Some users report better stability than Matter.js in certain situations.58 Complete Box2D algorithm implementation.52  
  * *Weaknesses:* Smaller community and potentially less frequent updates compared to Matter.js.52 Documentation might be less comprehensive or rely on Box2D documentation.58 Performance relative to Matter.js is debated and benchmark-dependent.56  
  * *Suitability:* A strong alternative if Matter.js exhibits stability or performance issues that cannot be resolved through tuning.

**Recommendation:** Begin implementation with **Matter.js**.51 Its native JavaScript implementation, extensive feature set, active development, and ease of integration make it a practical starting point for the required physics.52 Performance should be adequate for the Line Rider-like mechanics. However, rigorous testing on target low-end devices is essential. Monitor for stability issues, particularly high-speed collisions or tunneling.55 If significant, unresolvable problems arise, evaluate **Planck.js** 52 as a fallback, leveraging its Box2D foundation for potentially greater stability.58

For the described use case, the development convenience and feature set of Matter.js offer initial advantages. The physics simulation is not expected to be the primary performance bottleneck compared to rendering the infinite timeline, making Matter.js a reasonable choice unless proven otherwise through testing.

**2.4. Potential Math Animation Libraries (Manim.js / Alternatives)**

The request includes exploring AI generation of "Manim-like" math animations. Manim itself is a powerful Python library 59, not directly executable in the browser.

* **Manim (Python):** The reference point for high-quality, code-driven mathematical animations.59 AI generation typically targets producing Manim Python scripts.32 Browser execution requires a different approach.  
* **Manim Web Ports (e.g., Manim.js, manim-web):** Efforts exist to bring Manim functionality to the web using JavaScript/WASM.65 Manim.js appears to be an independent project inspired by Manim.65 Manim-web aims for WebGL rendering but notes significant challenges, such as the lack of geometry shaders in WebGL.66 These ports are likely experimental, potentially unstable, and may lack the full feature set and polish of the Python original. Relying on them for production carries risk.  
* **JS Alternatives:**  
  * *Three.js:* Capable of creating various mathematical visualizations and animations directly using its geometry, material, and animation systems.44 Suitable for simpler geometric transformations, plotting, and object animations.  
  * *MathLikeAnim-rs:* A Rust library using WASM to enable interactive mathematical animations in the browser (Canvas/SVG).67 Inspired by Manim and explicitly designed for interactivity. Its maturity and feature set need evaluation, but the concept aligns well with the project goals.  
  * *p5.js:* A JS library focused on creative coding and graphics, suitable for simpler 2D animations and visualizations.59  
  * *Theatre.js:* A JavaScript animation library for motion graphics, potentially useful for choreographing complex sequences.70

Recommendation: Avoid direct reliance on current Manim web ports 65 due to their likely experimental nature and potential instability.  
If high-fidelity Manim animations are essential and AI generation targets Python scripts, implement a server-side rendering pipeline:

1. AI generates Manim Python script based on prompt.  
2. Backend server executes the script using Manim.  
3. Server sends the resulting video or image sequence to the client.  
4. Client displays the pre-rendered animation. This approach sacrifices real-time interactivity for guaranteed Manim output.

For browser-native, interactive animations, leverage the capabilities of the primary rendering library, **Three.js** 44, for simpler visualizations. For more complex, dedicated animation sequences, investigate **Theatre.js** 70 for its choreographic tools or **MathLikeAnim-rs** 67 if its interactive features and maturity align with project needs. Crucially, the AI content generation strategy (Section 4\) must be adapted to output parameters or scripts compatible with the *chosen client-side library*, not necessarily Manim Python scripts.

Replicating Manim's full capabilities and rendering quality directly in the browser is a formidable task.66 A pragmatic approach involves either accepting pre-rendered output from a server or utilizing capable JavaScript libraries and tailoring the AI generation accordingly, potentially accepting some visual differences from native Manim output in exchange for browser-native interactivity.

## **3\. Architectural Design for Performance**

Achieving smooth performance, particularly on low-end hardware like Smart TVs 24, requires a deliberate architectural approach focused on efficiency from the outset. This involves careful structuring of the application, optimized rendering strategies, intelligent code and asset loading, and leveraging platform features like PWAs.

**3.1. Core Architectural Patterns**

A modular and maintainable structure is essential for managing complexity and facilitating development.

* **Component-Based Architecture:** Employing a component-based architecture is highly recommended. This aligns with modern web development practices and frameworks like Svelte, Vue, or React.71 Each distinct piece of functionality (e.g., the timeline view, a specific numeracy exercise, UI controls) should be encapsulated within its own component. This promotes reusability, testability, and easier maintenance. Native Web Components could be used, but a framework typically provides better tooling and structure.  
* **State Management:** Application state (e.g., current timeline position, zoom level, numeracy exercise progress, user settings) needs careful management. For simpler state needs confined within components or closely related components, the built-in reactivity of frameworks like Svelte 73 or Vue might suffice. For more complex, cross-cutting state (e.g., synchronizing timeline events with potentially related numeracy exercises), a more structured approach like Svelte Stores 73 or dedicated state management libraries (if using React/Vue) should be considered. Minimize reliance on global state to prevent unintended side effects and simplify debugging. State updates should trigger minimal necessary re-renders.  
* **Rendering Engine Integration:** The core rendering library (Three.js) should be encapsulated within specific components responsible for the WebGL canvas (e.g., \<TimelineView\>, \<BaseTenExercise\>). A central animation loop, driven by requestAnimationFrame 83, will manage updates to the Three.js scene and physics engine (Matter.js). Component lifecycle methods (e.g., mount/unmount) should handle the setup and teardown of Three.js resources and physics bodies to prevent memory leaks.

**3.2. Optimized Rendering Techniques**

Minimizing the workload on both the CPU and GPU is paramount for low-end devices.

* **WebGL Batching/Instancing:** This is arguably the most critical optimization for the GPU. Three.js provides mechanisms for geometry batching and instancing. Repeated elements, such as timeline markers or base-10 unit blocks, should be rendered using InstancedMesh to drastically reduce the number of draw calls issued to the GPU.84 Combining static geometries with compatible materials into single meshes where possible also reduces draw calls.84 Fewer draw calls mean less CPU overhead preparing data and fewer state changes on the GPU.87  
* **Minimizing DOM Manipulation:** As established, frequent DOM updates are slow.22 The core visualizations rendered via WebGL bypass the DOM for graphics. Any necessary UI overlays built with DOM/SVG should be updated judiciously. Frameworks with virtual DOMs (React, Vue) help optimize this, while compiler-based frameworks (Svelte) minimize runtime DOM work altogether.71  
* **Scene Graph Optimization (Three.js):** Structure the Three.js scene graph efficiently. Group static objects that don't change transform. Leverage Three.js's built-in frustum culling (objects outside the camera's view are not rendered). For very complex scenes, investigate manual occlusion culling techniques if objects frequently obscure each other, though this adds significant complexity. Keep the scene graph as flat as reasonably possible for faster traversal. (Analogous concepts discussed in Unity optimization contexts 84).  
* **Throttling/Debouncing:** User interactions like zooming or panning the timeline can trigger frequent events. Throttle the event handlers (e.g., using lodash.throttle or similar) to limit the rate at which expensive updates (like data loading or re-rendering) occur. Debounce actions that should only happen after a period of inactivity (e.g., saving user marker position after dragging stops).73

**3.3. Code Splitting and Loading Strategies**

Reducing the initial download size and deferring the loading of non-critical resources improves startup time and perceived performance.

* **Route-based/Component-level Splitting:** Utilize dynamic import() statements to split the JavaScript bundle. Load code for the timeline module only when the user navigates to it, and similarly for different numeracy exercise types. Modern build tools like Vite excel at this.26 Frameworks like SvelteKit, Nuxt, and Next.js provide built-in support for route-based code splitting.  
* **Asset Loading:** Large assets like 3D models (if used beyond simple primitives), complex textures, or audio files should be loaded asynchronously. Display loading indicators to manage user perception. Prioritize loading assets essential for the initial view. For WebGL textures, consider using compressed formats like Basis Universal, which offer smaller file sizes and faster GPU upload times, although this requires a specific encoding step.94  
* **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for content that is not immediately visible. For the timeline, this means only loading event/marker data for the currently visible time range and zoom level (see Section 5.1). For numeracy exercises, potentially lazy-load specific exercise variations or assets only when selected. This applies to both data and associated component code.73

**3.4. Potential Use of WebAssembly (WASM)**

WebAssembly allows running code compiled from languages like C++ or Rust in the browser at near-native speed.

* **Potential Use Cases:** Identify computationally intensive, pure-logic tasks that might bottleneck JavaScript. Potential candidates include:  
  * Complex physics calculations if the chosen JS engine (Matter.js) proves inadequate on target devices. Some physics engines have WASM ports (e.g., Box2DWASM 58).  
  * Large-scale data processing or filtering for the timeline, especially if complex algorithms are needed for LOD generation or querying.  
  * Complex mathematical computations for animations if using a library like MathLikeAnim-rs, which already leverages WASM.67  
* **Trade-offs:** WASM can offer significant performance benefits for CPU-bound tasks. However, it introduces build complexity (requiring WASM compilation toolchains), increases initial download size (WASM binary), and involves managing the JS-WASM communication bridge.  
* **Recommendation:** Defer WASM implementation unless performance profiling clearly identifies a critical bottleneck in a specific, well-defined JavaScript module that cannot be optimized otherwise. The overhead and complexity may not be justified initially, especially given the focus on GPU optimization for rendering. Start with pure JS and optimize, using WASM as a targeted solution if necessary.

**3.5. PWA Features for Performance and Offline Access**

Progressive Web App features enhance performance, reliability, and user experience.

* **Service Workers:** Implement a service worker script to act as a network proxy.28 Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS bundles, core images/icons) aggressively using a cache-first strategy for speed.28 Cache dynamic content like API responses (timeline data, AI-generated exercise parameters) using network-first or stale-while-revalidate strategies, depending on data freshness needs. Define a clear strategy for cache invalidation and updates.  
* **App Manifest:** Define a manifest.json file to make the application installable.29 Key properties include name, short\_name, icons (multiple sizes needed, e.g., 192px, 512px), start\_url, display (set to standalone for an app-like feel without browser chrome), and background\_color.29  
* **Offline Strategy:** Clearly define the offline user experience. Which exercises are available? Can the timeline be viewed with cached data? Service workers can cache API responses, allowing access to previously viewed content or pre-cached exercises offline. Provide clear UI feedback when the user is offline.  
* **Performance Benefit:** Service worker caching dramatically improves load times after the first visit by serving assets directly from the cache, bypassing the network. This is particularly impactful on slow mobile networks or less powerful devices.28

In essence, optimizing for low-end devices requires a multi-faceted strategy. It's not just about choosing WebGL, but about using it efficiently (batching, instancing 85), minimizing work on the CPU (limiting DOM interaction, using efficient frameworks like Svelte 71), loading resources intelligently (code splitting, lazy loading 26), and leveraging platform capabilities like PWA caching 28 to reduce latency and network dependency.

## **4\. AI-Driven Content Generation Strategy**

A core requirement is the significant use of AI to generate various content types, aiming for dynamic and potentially personalized learning experiences. Given the constraints (browser-based, performance-sensitive), the strategy focuses on using AI to generate structured data (parameters, scenarios) rather than raw assets or executable code.

**4.1. Overall Architecture**

* **AI Model Hosting:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o or Claude, and potentially specialized models for tasks like physics parameter generation, are computationally intensive. They will almost certainly need to be hosted in the cloud.95 Running capable LLMs locally within a browser application, especially on low-end devices, is currently impractical due to size and processing requirements.  
* **Client-AI Interface:** A clear API boundary is essential. The client-side web application (running in the user's browser) should not interact directly with third-party AI service APIs due to security (API keys) and potential complexity. Instead, the client will communicate with a dedicated backend service. This backend acts as a proxy, managing requests to the appropriate cloud-based AI models.  
* **Data Format:** **JSON** is the recommended data format for communication between the AI/backend and the client application.36 Modern LLMs can be effectively prompted or fine-tuned to generate structured JSON output that adheres to a predefined schema.37 Techniques include providing JSON schemas in the prompt, using few-shot examples, leveraging built-in JSON modes (available in some models/APIs like Gemini 37), or utilizing function calling/tool use capabilities.37 This structured approach is far more reliable and easier for the client to parse and utilize than attempting to parse natural language responses or, more riskily, execute AI-generated code.  
* **Backend Service Role:** A lightweight backend service is necessary. Its responsibilities include:  
  * Securely managing API keys for cloud AI services.  
  * Receiving requests from the client (e.g., "generate a base-10 addition exercise for level 2").  
  * Translating client requests into appropriate prompts for the LLM(s), including necessary context, constraints, and the desired JSON schema.  
  * Sending prompts to the AI service(s).  
  * Receiving the AI response (ideally JSON).  
  * Performing basic validation and sanitization of the AI-generated JSON.  
  * Potentially caching common AI responses to reduce latency and cost.  
  * Forwarding the validated JSON data to the client.

**4.2. Feasibility Assessment & Approach: Manim-like Math Animations**

* **Feasibility:**  
  * *Direct Client-Side Replication:* Low. Replicating the full visual fidelity and complex rendering pipeline of Manim 59 in real-time using WebGL/Three.js is extremely challenging.66 AI generating functional Three.js code for arbitrary complex animations is unreliable and risky.81  
  * *Server-Side Rendering:* Medium-High. AI generates a Manim Python script 32, a server executes it, and the client receives a video/image sequence. This guarantees Manim visuals but lacks interactivity and adds server load/latency.  
  * *Parameter Generation for Client Templates:* High. Define a library of pre-built, parameterized animation components in Three.js (e.g., animating objects along a path, transforming shapes, visualizing grouping). AI generates JSON specifying which template to use and its parameters.  
* **Challenges:** Defining a sufficiently expressive set of client-side templates; prompting the AI to correctly map pedagogical goals to template parameters; ensuring the generated parameters result in clear, accurate, and engaging animations for pre-literate children. AI code generation carries risks of errors and security vulnerabilities.81  
* **Proposed Approach (Parameter Generation):**  
  1. **Develop Client Templates:** Create a library of reusable animation functions/components in Three.js (e.g., animateNumberLineJump(start, end), visualizeGrouping(objects, targetGroup), transformShape(startShape, endShape, duration)).  
  2. **Define JSON Schema:** Specify JSON structures for invoking each template (e.g., {"template": "numberLineJump", "params": {"start": 3, "end": 7}}).  
  3. **AI Prompting:** Instruct the LLM (e.g., GPT-4o 61, Claude 97) with the learning objective, target audience constraints (visual, simple, no text), and the available template schemas.  
  4. **AI Generates JSON:** The LLM outputs JSON selecting and parameterizing a template.  
  5. **Client Execution:** The client parses the JSON and calls the corresponding pre-built Three.js animation function.  
* **Rationale:** This approach leverages AI for generating the *what* (which animation and with what values) while keeping the *how* (the rendering and animation logic) securely and performantly implemented in tested client-side code. It aligns with the browser-based technology goal and allows for interactivity within the generated animations if templates are designed accordingly.

**4.3. Feasibility Assessment & Approach: Physics Game Scenarios (Line Rider-like)**

* **Feasibility:** High. Defining 2D level layouts and physics parameters is a constrained task suitable for current AI. PCG and level generation are common AI applications in games.31  
* **Challenges:** Ensuring playability (level is solvable), appropriate difficulty tuning for young children (avoiding frustration), generating sufficient variety, and aligning generated levels with potential implicit learning goals (e.g., understanding gravity or momentum intuitively).  
* **Proposed Approach:**  
  1. **Parameterize Level:** Define the components of a "Line Rider" level structure via parameters: start position, goal position, control points for track splines (using e.g., Bezier curves manageable in Three.js), positions and types of simple obstacles (static blocks, bouncy pads), target object locations (if any).  
  2. **Define JSON Schema:** Create a JSON structure to hold these parameters (e.g., {"startPos": \[x, y\], "goalPos": \[x, y\], "tracks": \[\[cp1x, cp1y,...\],...\], "obstacles": \[{"type": "block", "pos": \[x,y\], "size": \[w,h\]},...\]}).  
  3. **AI Prompting:** Provide the LLM with the JSON schema, constraints related to the target age (simple tracks, few obstacles, clear goal), and potentially examples of good/bad levels. Specify the desired output format as JSON.  
  4. **AI Generates JSON:** The LLM outputs the level parameters in the specified JSON format.  
  5. **Client Construction:** The client parses the JSON and uses Matter.js 51 to create the physics bodies (track segments, obstacles) and Three.js to render them. Physics simulation tutorials exist.101  
* **Rationale:** This is a classic PCG task 31 well-suited to AI parameter generation. JSON provides a clean interface between the AI and the client's physics/rendering engines.

**4.4. Feasibility Assessment & Approach: Infinite Timeline Data/Markers**

* **Feasibility:**  
  * *Populating Known Events:* High. Existing historical event APIs can be queried.107  
  * *Generating Novel/Abstract Events:* Medium. LLMs can generate plausible-sounding events for periods lacking concrete data (e.g., early Earth history 11), but ensuring accuracy and age-appropriateness requires careful prompting and potentially filtering.  
  * *Data Scaling/LOD:* Medium. AI could potentially be used to summarize periods or select representative events for different zoom levels, but defining the logic and ensuring meaningful summaries is complex.  
* **Challenges:** Sourcing comprehensive, reliable, *and* child-friendly data across vast timescales (personal to cosmological). Ensuring factual accuracy if generating events. Implementing effective Level of Detail (LOD) for markers and labels at different zoom levels. Filtering API results for relevance and simplicity.  
* **Proposed Approach:**  
  1. **Hybrid Data Sourcing:**  
     * *APIs:* Use APIs like API-Ninjas Historical Events 109, Wikimedia On This Day 112, or potentially curated educational sources for specific historical periods. Filter responses heavily for simplicity and relevance to children (e.g., focus on inventions, animals, major natural events).  
     * *Curated Datasets:* Manually create or adapt existing datasets for specific eras relevant to the curriculum (e.g., dinosaur periods, major human milestones simplified). Store these in a backend database.  
     * *AI Generation (Targeted):* Use LLMs primarily for generating illustrative markers for very abstract or deep time concepts where concrete data is unavailable (e.g., "First life appears," "Big Bang"). Prompting must emphasize extreme simplicity. Output format: **JSON** markers ({"time": \-3.8e9, "label\_icon": "simple\_life\_icon", "description\_audio": "url\_to\_audio"}).  
  2. **Data Loading/LOD:** Implement dynamic loading based on the visible time range and zoom level (Section 5.1). For LOD, start with simple rules (e.g., show only major era markers when zoomed out \> 1 billion years, show century markers when \< 1000 years, etc.). AI-driven summarization/selection can be explored later if needed.  
  3. **AI for Querying/Filtering:** Potentially use an LLM in the backend to interpret natural language queries if a search feature is added, or to help filter/simplify event descriptions from APIs before sending JSON to the client.  
* **Rationale:** Relying solely on AI for all timeline data is risky due to accuracy and age-appropriateness concerns. A hybrid approach combining reliable APIs, curated data, and targeted AI generation for abstract concepts offers better control and quality. JSON is the appropriate format for marker data.

**4.5. Feasibility Assessment & Approach: Interactive Base-10 Exercises (Three.js)**

* **Feasibility:**  
  * *Generating Exercise Scenarios/Parameters:* High. Defining the setup and goal of a base-10 exercise is a structured task suitable for LLMs.  
  * *Generating Interactive Three.js Code:* Low. As with animations, generating robust, error-free, and pedagogically sound interactive code directly is highly challenging and risky.81  
* **Challenges:** Designing effective interactive templates in Three.js; ensuring AI-generated scenarios are pedagogically valid and progressively challenging; mapping learning objectives to specific scenario parameters.  
* **Proposed Approach:**  
  1. **Develop Core Exercise Components:** Create reusable Three.js components implementing core base-10 interactions (e.g., a BlockManager for creating/manipulating units/rods/flats, a ComparisonZone for drag-and-drop comparison, a GroupingTool for visualizing regrouping).1 These components handle the rendering and interaction logic.  
  2. **Define JSON Scenario Schema:** Create JSON structures to configure these components for specific exercises (e.g., {"exerciseType": "grouping", "initialUnits": 14, "goal": "make\_one\_ten", "allowedTools": \["group\_button"\]}).  
  3. **AI Prompting:** Instruct the LLM with the desired learning outcome (e.g., "Create an exercise to show that 12 ones is the same as 1 ten and 2 ones"), target age, difficulty level, and the available component schemas.  
  4. **AI Generates JSON:** The LLM outputs a JSON object defining the exercise setup and parameters.  
  5. **Client Configuration:** The client parses the JSON and instantiates/configures the appropriate Three.js components to present the exercise.  
* **Rationale:** This decouples the AI's role (scenario definition) from the client's role (interaction implementation and rendering). It leverages AI for variety and potentially adaptive difficulty 114 while ensuring the core interactions are robust and performant, built directly using Three.js.

The overarching strategy across all content types is clear: use AI, particularly LLMs, as a powerful **parameter and scenario generator**, outputting structured **JSON** data.36 This data then drives pre-built, well-tested, and performant components within the client-side web application. This approach mitigates the risks and complexities of direct AI code or asset generation 81 while still harnessing AI's ability to create dynamic and varied content, fitting the project's technical constraints and goals.

**AI Content Generation Feasibility Summary**

| Content Type | Proposed AI Approach | Feasibility Score | Key Challenges |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Manim-like Animations | LLM \-\> JSON Parameters for Client JS Templates | Medium | Template expressiveness, pedagogical accuracy, visual clarity for target age |
| Physics Game Scenarios | LLM \-\> JSON Level Parameters (Splines, Obstacles) | High | Playability, difficulty tuning for pre-literates, variety |
| Infinite Timeline Data | API Integration \+ Curated Data \+ Targeted LLM (JSON) | High (Hybrid) | Data sourcing (child-friendly, vast scale), accuracy, LOD implementation |
| Base-10 Exercises | LLM \-\> JSON Scenario/Parameters for Client Components | High | Pedagogical validity, interaction design, progressive difficulty |

## **5\. Feature Design: Infinite Zooming Timeline**

The infinite zooming timeline is a core feature requiring careful design for both data handling and user experience, especially given the target audience and performance constraints.

**5.1. Data Handling Strategy**

Handling a potentially vast range of time, from potentially the Big Bang (\~13.8 billion years ago) to the present and near future, necessitates efficient data management.

* **Data Source:** As outlined in Section 4.4, data will be a mix of curated datasets (for specific eras like dinosaurs or human history), real-time API calls for recent/specific historical events 107, and potentially AI-generated markers for abstract/deep time points. This data needs to be stored or accessed via a backend service.  
* **Data Virtualization:** It is computationally infeasible to load and render all potential timeline markers simultaneously. A virtualization strategy is mandatory. The client application must only request and render data relevant to the current viewport (defined by the visible time range and zoom level). As the user pans or zooms, the application must dynamically query the backend for new data corresponding to the emerging view and discard data that is no longer visible. This requires efficient backend querying (e.g., indexed by time) and client-side data management.  
* **Level of Detail (LOD):** To prevent visual clutter and maintain performance at broad zoom levels (e.g., viewing billions of years), an LOD system for markers is essential.  
  * *Zoomed Out:* Display only major epochs, eras, or highly significant events (e.g., "Formation of Earth," "First Life," "Dinosaur Era," "First Humans"). These could be represented by larger, simpler icons or colored bands along the timeline. AI might assist in generating summary labels for vast periods if needed.  
  * *Zooming In:* As the user zooms, progressively reveal more granular events – periods, specific historical events, eventually individual years or even finer scales for personal timelines. The density of markers increases with zoom level.  
  * *Implementation:* This requires associating events/markers with significance levels or zoom ranges. Queries to the backend should include the current zoom level/time range to fetch data at the appropriate LOD. This concept is analogous to LOD used in 3D graphics to simplify distant objects.118  
* **Data Structure:** On the backend, a database indexed efficiently by time is crucial. On the client, data structures like interval trees or spatial partitioning structures (adapted for 1D time) could potentially help manage and query the currently loaded markers for rendering and interaction, although efficient filtering based on the visible time range might suffice.

**5.2. Visualization Technique**

The visual representation must be intuitive, performant, and handle the transition across vast scales.

* **Rendering:** Utilize WebGL via Three.js for rendering the timeline axis and markers.41 Markers can be implemented as efficient InstancedMesh if many similar markers are visible, or as simple sprites (Sprite) or basic geometries (PlaneGeometry with textures) for unique events. Text rendering in WebGL can be complex; prioritize icons and visual cues, using minimal text rendered perhaps onto textures or using specialized text geometry techniques if necessary.44  
* **Scaling (Logarithmic vs. Linear):** This is a critical design choice.  
  * *Logarithmic Scale:* Essential for visualizing the entirety of deep time 11 on a single view, as it compresses vast intervals.119 However, it poses significant perceptual challenges: users, especially children without formal math training 122, struggle to intuitively grasp relative durations or the magnitude of intervals on a log scale.119 Misinterpretations are common.124 If used, clear visual indicators are needed: non-uniformly spaced grid lines, explicit power-of-ten labels (though text should be minimized for the target audience), and potentially interactive guides explaining the scale. Careful consideration of label placement algorithms is needed to avoid overlap on compressed scales.127  
  * *Linear Scale:* Intuitive for comparing durations and intervals directly.119 However, it's impossible to display extreme time ranges (e.g., billions of years alongside single years) simultaneously; one end of the scale would be compressed into invisibility.119 Best suited for zoomed-in views focusing on specific, limited periods (e.g., a single century, a person's lifetime).  
  * *Hybrid/Dynamic Approach:* A potential solution is to dynamically transition between scales. Use a logarithmic scale for the broadest overview zooms. As the user zooms past a certain threshold (e.g., into historical or personal time scales), smoothly transition the visible segment to a linear scale for more intuitive duration comparison within that focused view. Visualizations like "Scale of the Universe 2" 12 and "Powers of Ten" 142 effectively manage visualization across many orders of magnitude, often implicitly using logarithmic transitions or focusing techniques. The key is a smooth, understandable transition.  
* **Label Placement:** Given the potential density of markers when zoomed in and the compression at zoomed-out levels, automatic label placement is crucial to avoid overlap.129 Since the target audience is pre-literate, prioritize icons over text labels. If text labels are used (perhaps for older children or parental guidance), employ algorithms that minimize collisions. Techniques could include:  
  * *Greedy Algorithms:* Simple and fast, placing labels sequentially and nudging to avoid immediate conflicts.128  
  * *Bitmap-Based:* Rasterize existing elements to a bitmap and check for overlaps efficiently.131  
  * *Force-Directed (Less Ideal):* Can produce good results but may be too slow for real-time interaction on this scale.128  
  * *Show on Hover/Select:* Only display detailed labels/info when a marker is interacted with, keeping the main view clean.

**5.3. User Interaction**

Interaction must be simple and intuitive for young children.

* **Navigation:**  
  * *Zooming:* Implement zooming via mouse scroll wheel, trackpad pinch gestures, or on-screen buttons (using simple \+/- icons). Zooming should be smooth and centered on the cursor or pinch point.  
  * *Panning:* Allow panning by clicking and dragging (mouse) or touch-and-drag on touchscreens.  
  * *Performance:* Ensure navigation remains fluid even when loading new data, using techniques like throttling updates 73 and optimizing rendering (Section 3.2). Visual feedback during loading (e.g., subtle loading indicators for newly appearing sections) is important. References like 146 and 147 discuss general SVG/JS timeline interactions.  
* **User Markers:** Provide a simple mechanism (e.g., a dedicated "Add My Event" button) for users to place their own markers on the timeline.13 This could involve selecting an icon and placing it at the current time focus. These markers need to be visually distinct from system-generated events and persistent (e.g., using browser localStorage for simplicity, or backend storage if user accounts are implemented).  
* **Information Display (Details-on-Demand):** When a user clicks or taps on an event marker, display associated information visually. Instead of text descriptions, use relevant images, simple icons, or short, pre-recorded audio snippets explaining the event in child-friendly language. This follows the "details-on-demand" principle common in data visualization.149

The core challenge of the infinite timeline lies in balancing the need to represent vast scales (necessitating techniques like logarithmic scaling and LOD 11) with the intuitive understanding required for young children.6 Data virtualization and performant WebGL rendering 41 are technical prerequisites, but the user experience design, particularly the handling of scale transitions and information display for pre-literate users, will determine its educational effectiveness.

## **6\. Feature Design: Numeracy Exercises (Pre-Literate Focus)**

The numeracy exercises must be highly visual, interactive, and grounded in concrete representations to be effective for pre-literate children. The design should leverage principles from developmental psychology and successful early math applications.

**6.1. Visual Representation of Base-10 Concepts**

The base-10 system is abstract. Visual and interactive manipulatives are key to building intuition.

* **Interactive 3D Blocks:** Utilize Three.js 43 to render clear, distinct 3D representations of base-10 blocks: small cubes for units (ones), rods composed of 10 units (tens), and flats composed of 10 rods (hundreds).1 Thousands cubes can be added if the scope extends that far. The 3D nature allows for better spatial understanding compared to 2D representations.  
* **Direct Manipulation:** Allow children to directly interact with these blocks using simple touch/drag-and-drop or mouse-click-and-drag actions.150 They should be able to pick up units, stack them, arrange them into groups, and physically combine/separate groups. This aligns with embodied learning principles, where physical-like interaction reinforces conceptual understanding.15  
* **Visual Grouping and Regrouping:** This is crucial for understanding place value. Design animations and interactions that clearly show:  
  * 10 individual unit blocks snapping together to form a single ten-rod.  
  * A ten-rod breaking apart into 10 individual unit blocks.  
  * Similar visualizations for grouping/ungrouping tens into hundreds. The visual transformation should be explicit and reinforce the equivalence (10 ones \= 1 ten). Avoid relying on abstract symbols like "+" or "=" initially.  
* **Concrete to Abstract Progression:** Following Piaget's stages of cognitive development 34, the exercises should start with purely concrete, manipulative tasks. Only introduce numerical symbols (digits 1-9, 0\) later, associating them directly with the visual quantities they represent (e.g., showing the digit '3' next to a group of 3 unit blocks). This bridges the gap between concrete quantity and abstract representation.6

**6.2. Magnitude Comparison Interfaces**

Developing number sense includes understanding relative magnitudes.19

* **Visual Metaphors:** Design interfaces that allow children to compare quantities visually and intuitively, rather than just comparing abstract numerals.157 Examples:  
  * Comparing the height of two stacks of blocks.  
  * Comparing the length of two lines of objects.  
  * Visually comparing the area covered by two groups of items.  
  * Using familiar objects (e.g., apples, animals) grouped together. Inspiration can be drawn from apps like DragonBox Numbers/Big Numbers 5 and Funexpected Math 9, which use characters and playful scenarios.  
* **Estimation Activities:** Incorporate games that encourage approximate comparison and estimation.183 Examples:  
  * "Which tower is taller?" (Comparing stacks of blocks).  
  * "Are there more blue dots or red dots?" (Comparing visually distinct sets).  
  * "Drag the group that has *about* 10 apples." Provide immediate visual feedback confirming the comparison (e.g., highlighting the larger group, showing a checkmark). Funexpected Math explicitly lists "Estimation and Number Intuition" in its curriculum.9  
* **Visual Number Line:** Introduce a number line not just as abstract ticks, but visually populated with objects or increasing block sizes to connect sequential order with magnitude. Children could place groups of blocks onto the number line to see where they fit.

**6.3. Interaction Design for Young Children**

The interface must be tailored to the limited motor skills and cognitive load capacity of preschoolers.

* **Minimal Text:** Interfaces must be predominantly visual.7 Use clear icons, bright colors, and distinct shapes. Any necessary instructions should be given via voice-over or simple animations. Text labels should be avoided or optional.  
* **Intuitive Input:** Design for large touch targets and simple gestures (tap, drag-and-drop) on touch devices.1 On desktops, use simple mouse clicks and drags. Avoid requiring precise pointing, double-clicks, or keyboard input. Interaction should feel natural and direct.151  
* **Direct Manipulation:** Children should feel like they are directly acting upon the virtual objects (blocks, groups).150 The connection between their action (e.g., dragging a block) and the visual result should be immediate and clear. This supports embodied learning principles.15  
* **Feedback:** Provide constant, immediate, and encouraging feedback.  
  * *Visual:* Objects should highlight when touched/hovered, snap into place clearly, animate engagingly during grouping/ungrouping, and provide positive visual confirmation (e.g., sparkles, checkmarks) for correct actions.  
  * *Auditory:* Use simple, positive sounds for successful actions, interactions, and task completion. Avoid harsh or negative sounds for errors.  
  * *Error Handling:* Design for exploration. Incorrect actions should not block progress but gently guide the child towards the correct interaction or allow them to try again without penalty. Trial-and-error is part of the learning process.9  
* **Engagement:** Maintain interest through playful elements. Use appealing characters (potentially AI-driven variations), bright visuals, simple narratives framing the exercises (e.g., "Help the character build a tower of 10"), and rewarding animations or sounds upon completion.9 AI can generate varied scenarios (Section 4.5) to prevent repetition.

The design philosophy for these exercises must be rooted in making abstract numerical concepts tangible and manipulable.153 By aligning with developmental psychology principles 6 and focusing on intuitive, visual interaction 9, the application can effectively build foundational number sense in its young target audience.

## **7\. Deployment Strategy**

The goal is to achieve broad hardware compatibility, including low-end devices and Smart TVs, with a focus on browser-based technologies and easy deployment. A Progressive Web App (PWA) approach is central to this strategy.

**7.1. Packaging for Broad Compatibility**

* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** This is the recommended primary deployment target.28 PWAs offer several advantages aligned with the project goals:  
  * *Installability:* Users can install the app to their home screen or desktop from the browser, providing an app-like experience without needing an app store.29  
  * *Offline Access:* Service workers enable caching of application code, assets, and potentially data, allowing parts of the application to function offline or in low-network conditions.28 This is valuable for accessibility and reliability.  
  * *Discoverability:* Accessible via a standard URL, shareable via links.  
  * *Cross-Platform:* Runs on any device with a compatible browser (desktop, mobile, potentially some TVs).  
* **Manifest Configuration:** A manifest.json file is required for PWA installability.29 It should define:  
  * name and short\_name: For display on the home screen/app list.  
  * icons: Multiple sizes (e.g., 192x192, 512x512) for different contexts.29  
  * start\_url: The entry point of the application.  
  * display: Set to standalone to hide browser UI chrome for a native app feel.29  
  * background\_color and theme\_color: For the splash screen during launch.  
* **Service Worker Strategy:** Implement a service worker using libraries like Workbox or framework integrations (e.g., SvelteKit's service worker support).  
  * *Caching:* Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS bundles, core images, fonts) using a cache-first strategy for speed.28 Cache dynamic content like API responses (timeline data, AI-generated exercise parameters) using network-first or stale-while-revalidate strategies, depending on data freshness needs. Define a clear strategy for cache invalidation and updates.  
  * *Offline Functionality:* Design specific offline capabilities. For example, allow access to previously completed exercises or cached sections of the timeline. Provide a clear offline indicator and potentially a dedicated offline mode with limited functionality.

**7.2. Responsive Design**

The application must adapt visually and functionally across a wide range of screen sizes and aspect ratios.

* **Layout:** Use flexible CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) and relative units (%, vh, vw, em) rather than fixed pixel values.  
* **Breakpoints:** Define breakpoints to adjust layout, font sizes, and potentially UI element visibility for different screen categories (mobile, tablet, desktop, TV).  
* **Interaction Adaptation:** Ensure interactions work effectively on both touch (tap, drag, pinch) and pointer-based (mouse click/drag, TV remote D-pad) devices. Touch target sizes should be generous for mobile usability.  
* **Testing:** Use browser developer tools for simulating different devices and resolutions. Test extensively on real devices, including various mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and target Smart TVs.

The PWA approach offers the most streamlined path to broad compatibility.29 However, the unique constraints of the Smart TV ecosystem 24 represent the most significant deployment risk. Early and continuous testing on target TV hardware, coupled with aggressive performance optimization, is critical. A native wrapper fallback should be considered a contingency plan if PWA deployment fails to meet requirements on essential TV platforms.

## **8\. Development Workflow & Tooling**

A development workflow optimized for rapid iteration and immediate feedback is crucial, especially when designing interactive experiences for children and integrating AI components.

**8.1. Recommended Frameworks/Libraries for Tight Iteration**

Choosing a front-end framework impacts developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

* **Svelte/SvelteKit:**  
  * *Pros:* Compiles components to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time, eliminating runtime framework overhead and typically resulting in smaller bundles and faster performance.71 Reactive declarations simplify state management for many cases.73 Generally considered easier to learn than React, with syntax closer to standard HTML/CSS/JS.71 SvelteKit provides a full-featured meta-framework with routing, SSR, API routes, and build optimizations.93 Excellent developer satisfaction reported.72  
  * *Cons:* Smaller ecosystem and community compared to React.72 Fewer pre-built component libraries, though growing.  
  * *Suitability:* Strong fit due to performance focus (aligns with low-end hardware) and good developer experience (aligns with tight loops).  
* **Vue/Nuxt:**  
  * *Pros:* Progressive framework, often considered easier to learn than React.74 Good performance with a virtual DOM implementation. Growing ecosystem and strong community support.190 Nuxt provides a powerful meta-framework.  
  * *Cons:* Virtual DOM adds runtime overhead compared to Svelte. Ecosystem smaller than React's.  
  * *Suitability:* Viable alternative, offering a good balance of ease of use and performance.  
* **React/Next.js:**  
  * *Pros:* Largest ecosystem, vast number of libraries and components, huge community and talent pool.74 Mature tooling and extensive documentation. React Native offers paths to native mobile if needed (though less relevant here).  
  * *Cons:* Can have a steeper learning curve (JSX, state management patterns).71 Virtual DOM introduces runtime overhead (though React 19's compiler aims to mitigate this 71). Can sometimes lead to larger bundle sizes if not carefully managed. Developer satisfaction sometimes reported lower than Svelte/Vue.72  
  * *Suitability:* Powerful and capable, but potentially overkill and less performant out-of-the-box for low-end targets compared to Svelte unless the team has deep React optimization expertise.

**Recommendation:** **Svelte/SvelteKit** is strongly recommended.71 Its compiler-first approach directly addresses the critical need for runtime performance on low-end devices by minimizing framework overhead.71 The reported ease of learning and excellent developer experience, combined with SvelteKit's integrated tooling, supports the requirement for tight development loops.72

**8.2. Build Tools and Hot-Reloading**

Fast feedback cycles are essential for iterative design and development.

* **Vite:** Recommend **Vite** as the primary build tool and development server.26  
  * *Pros:* Near-instant server start and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) leveraging native ES modules, dramatically speeding up development feedback loops.26 Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules, etc..75 Uses Rollup for highly optimized production builds (code splitting, tree-shaking).27 Minimal configuration needed for common frameworks.27 Strong community adoption and integration with frameworks like SvelteKit, Nuxt, and React.76  
  * *Cons:* Relatively newer than Webpack, though now widely adopted and stable.  
  * *Suitability:* Perfectly aligns with the "tight development loops" requirement due to its exceptional HMR speed.  
* **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Vite's HMR allows changes in component code (JS, CSS, Svelte files) to be reflected in the running application in the browser almost instantly, often without losing application state.26 This is invaluable for tweaking UI, testing interactions, and debugging logic rapidly.

**8.3. Vanilla JS vs. Frameworks**

* **Vanilla JS:** While offering maximum control and potentially the absolute smallest footprint if expertly crafted, building an application of this complexity (state management, component rendering, routing, WebGL integration, AI communication) in pure vanilla JS would be significantly slower and harder to maintain. The lack of structure and ecosystem support outweighs potential micro-optimizations.71  
* **Frameworks (Svelte Recommended):** Provide essential structure, reactivity, component model, tooling integration (like Vite HMR), and community resources, leading to faster development and better maintainability.72 Svelte's compile-time approach minimizes the typical runtime performance penalty associated with frameworks.71

**8.4. Performance Monitoring Tools**

Integrate performance analysis into the workflow from the beginning.

* **Browser DevTools:** Utilize the built-in Performance tab (profiling JS execution, rendering), Network tab (asset loading, API calls), and Lighthouse audits (overall performance, PWA checks) in Chrome/Edge/Firefox.93  
* **Real-time FPS Monitoring:** Use libraries like stats.js during development to get an immediate visual indication of frame rate.94  
* **WebGL Debugging:** Tools like spector.js (browser extension) can capture and analyze WebGL frames, showing draw calls and GPU state, useful for debugging rendering bottlenecks.94

The combination of Svelte/SvelteKit 72 and Vite 26 provides a modern, highly efficient development environment. Vite's fast HMR directly enables the requested tight iteration loops, while Svelte's compile-time optimizations contribute significantly to achieving the necessary runtime performance on resource-constrained devices like Smart TVs. This pairing offers a compelling solution to balance developer productivity with end-user performance.

## **9\. Conclusion & Recommendations**

**9.1. Summary of Findings**

This analysis confirms the feasibility of developing the proposed web-based educational application for teaching numeracy and timelines to pre-literate children using primarily browser technologies. The core concepts are achievable, but success hinges on careful technology choices and a strong focus on performance optimization.

* **Technology Stack:** WebGL, managed via the Three.js library, is the recommended foundation for the core interactive visualizations (timeline, 3D numeracy) due to performance requirements and 3D capabilities.22 Matter.js is suitable for the required 2D physics, offering ease of integration.51 Direct browser-based execution of complex Manim-style animations is challenging; generating parameters for simpler, pre-defined client-side animations is the more viable approach.32  
* **Architecture & Performance:** Performance, especially on low-end devices like Smart TVs 24, is the primary technical challenge. An architecture prioritizing GPU acceleration (WebGL batching/instancing 85), minimal CPU overhead (limited DOM use, efficient JS framework like Svelte 71), and smart loading strategies (code splitting, data virtualization, LOD for timeline 26) is essential.  
* **AI Content Generation:** AI (primarily LLMs) is highly feasible for generating *structured data* (JSON) to define exercise scenarios, physics level parameters, and potentially timeline markers.36 Generating executable code or raw complex assets directly poses significant risks and challenges.81 A backend proxy managing AI interactions is recommended.  
* **Feature Design:** The infinite timeline requires sophisticated data virtualization and LOD techniques, alongside careful consideration of logarithmic vs. linear scaling for usability.118 Numeracy exercises must be highly visual, interactive, and grounded in concrete representations, following principles of developmental psychology.1  
* **Deployment & Workflow:** PWA is the ideal deployment target for broad accessibility and offline features.29 Smart TV compatibility requires dedicated testing and optimization, potentially necessitating native wrappers as a fallback.24 A development workflow using Svelte/SvelteKit and Vite offers an optimal balance of rapid iteration (tight loops) and runtime performance.26

**9.2. Key Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are crucial for project success:

1. **Technology Selection:** Adopt **Three.js** as the primary rendering library for both 2D and 3D components. Utilize **Matter.js** for 2D physics, monitoring performance closely. For AI-driven animations, focus on generating **JSON parameters** to drive pre-built **Three.js** animation templates.  
2. **Performance-First Architecture:** Design the architecture with performance as a primary constraint from day one. Implement **WebGL instancing/batching**, minimize DOM interactions, use **code-splitting** and **lazy loading** extensively, and develop robust **data virtualization and LOD** strategies for the timeline.  
3. **AI Integration Strategy:** Implement AI content generation via a **backend proxy** that communicates with cloud-hosted LLMs. Focus AI on generating **structured JSON** for scenarios and parameters, not code. Begin with simpler AI tasks (e.g., physics levels) and iterate towards more complex ones (e.g., animation parameters).  
4. **User-Centric Design (Pre-Literate Focus):** Prioritize visual learning and direct manipulation in all feature designs. Minimize text reliance. Leverage insights from developmental psychology and early childhood education for UI/UX design.6 Ensure interactions are intuitive and forgiving.  
5. **Deployment Strategy:** Target **PWA** deployment initially.29 Conduct early and continuous **performance testing on target low-end hardware, including representative Smart TVs**.24 Be prepared to develop platform-specific wrappers if PWA performance or compatibility on essential TV platforms is insufficient.  
6. **Development Workflow:** Utilize **Svelte/SvelteKit** and **Vite** to maximize developer productivity (tight loops via fast HMR 26) and runtime performance (compiler optimizations 71).

**9.3. Critical Success Factors**

* **UX/UI Design:** Creating interfaces and interactions that are truly intuitive and engaging for pre-literate children (3-6 years old).  
* **Performance Optimization:** Successfully achieving fluid performance across the target hardware range, especially Smart TVs.  
* **AI Prompt Engineering & Validation:** Developing effective prompts and validation mechanisms to ensure AI generates pedagogically sound, accurate, and appropriate content parameters.  
* **Data Curation:** Sourcing or creating high-quality, age-appropriate data for the timeline across diverse scales.

**9.4. Potential Risks**

* **Hardware Limitations:** Target low-end devices (especially Smart TVs) may prove incapable of running the desired WebGL-based interactions smoothly, even with optimization.  
* **AI Variability & Cost:** AI generation might produce inconsistent quality, require extensive prompt tuning, or incur significant operational costs depending on usage.  
* **PWA Compatibility:** Inconsistent PWA support or performance across different Smart TV browsers and operating systems could necessitate costly platform-specific development.  
* **Pedagogical Effectiveness:** Ensuring the interactive designs and AI-generated content effectively teach the intended concepts to the target age group requires careful design and user testing.

By addressing these recommendations and mitigating the identified risks through careful planning, iterative development, and rigorous testing, the envisioned educational application has a strong potential to provide a unique and valuable learning experience for young children.

# Age 5 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 5**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

At this stage, learning is highly integrated, experiential, and focused on foundational skills that prepare children for more formal schooling. Play is a primary mode of learning. The trees will reflect this emphasis on emergent abilities and concrete experiences.

**Reasoning for Age 5 Trees:**

*   **Integration:** Subjects are less distinct. A single activity (like playing with blocks) hits Math (shapes, counting), Science (stability), Language (describing), Social (sharing), Creative (designing), and Physical (motor skills). The trees attempt to categorize the *intended focus* or *primary outcome* while acknowledging this overlap.
*   **Emergence:** Many skills are just beginning. We'll see nodes like "Emergent Writing" or "Pre-Reading Skills."
*   **Concreteness:** Learning is tied to tangible objects, direct experiences, and immediate environments (self, family, classroom, nature). Abstract concepts are introduced simply.
*   **Play-Based:** Much learning happens through structured and unstructured play. The trees represent the underlying skills being developed during play.
*   **Social-Emotional Core:** This age is crucial for developing self-regulation, understanding social rules, and interacting with peers. This will be prominent, especially in the Tautological tree.

# Age 10 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 10**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 10 (typically 4th or 5th Grade) represents a further step into more complex reasoning, research, and the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.

**Reasoning for Age 10 Trees:**

*   **Increased Abstraction & Complexity:** Operations with decimals and fractions become more prominent. Reading involves analyzing themes and author's craft. Writing requires more structure and evidence. Science explores systems and energy transfer. Social studies delves into more complex historical narratives and governmental structures.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Students are expected to gather information from multiple sources, evaluate them simply, and synthesize findings into reports or presentations.
*   **Argumentation & Evidence:** Beginning to form arguments supported by evidence from texts or data.
*   **Independence & Organization:** Greater expectation for managing assignments, organizing materials, and using study strategies.
*   **Fluency Application:** Applying mastered basic skills (reading fluency, math facts) to solve complex, multi-step problems and comprehend challenging texts.

title: Educator Knowledge Trees - Age 11 Capabilities
description: Defines the Pedagogical and Tautological knowledge trees outlining expected capabilities for a typical 11-year-old.
version: 1.0

# Age 11 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 11**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 11 (often 5th or 6th Grade) marks the transition towards middle school thinking, involving greater complexity in subject matter, increased expectations for analytical skills, and more sophisticated research and communication.

**Reasoning for Age 11 Trees:**

*   **Middle School Readiness:** Focus shifts towards skills needed for success in a departmentalized middle school setting – managing multiple subjects, longer-term assignments, and increased academic rigor.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Students engage more deeply with abstract concepts across subjects: ratios, proportions, variables in math; analyzing themes and author's craft in ELA; understanding systems and models in science; analyzing government structures and historical causality in social studies.
*   **Information Literacy & Argument:** Research involves evaluating sources more critically and synthesizing information. Argumentative writing requires clear claims, relevant evidence, and addressing counterclaims simply.
*   **Systems Thinking:** Emphasis on understanding interconnectedness within systems (biological, ecological, social, governmental).
*   **Independence & Metacognition:** Higher expectations for self-directed learning, time management, organization, and using strategies to monitor comprehension and task completion.

# Age 12 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 12**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 12 (typically 6th or 7th Grade) often marks the entry into middle school, characterized by increasing academic specialization, abstract reasoning, and the need for effective study habits.

**Reasoning for Age 12 Trees:**

*   **Abstract & Hypothetical Thinking:** Students increasingly engage with abstract concepts (e.g., negative numbers, variables, historical causality, scientific models) and hypothetical scenarios ("what if").
*   **Subject Depth:** Content within subjects becomes more specialized and complex. Expectation for deeper analysis and application of knowledge.
*   **Argumentation & Evidence:** Developing stronger argumentative skills, including acknowledging and refuting counterclaims (simple), and using specific evidence effectively.
*   **Research & Synthesis:** Research projects require evaluating a wider range of sources, synthesizing information coherently, and citing properly.
*   **Problem Solving:** Tackling more complex, multi-step problems across disciplines, often requiring integration of different skills or concepts.
*   **Self-Management:** Increased responsibility for managing long-term assignments, organizing work across multiple subjects, and utilizing effective study habits.

# Age 13 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 13**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 13 (typically 7th or 8th Grade) involves increasing complexity in academic subjects, the development of argumentative skills, and greater personal and social awareness.

**Reasoning for Age 13 Trees:**

*   **Formal Abstract Thought:** Solidifying ability to think abstractly, manipulate variables, understand complex systems, and engage in hypothetical reasoning. Algebra becomes central in math.
*   **Disciplinary Thinking:** Beginning to think more like a historian, scientist, mathematician, etc., using discipline-specific methods of inquiry and argumentation.
*   **Sophisticated Argumentation:** Constructing arguments with clear claims, counterclaims, strong evidence, and logical reasoning becomes a key focus, especially in ELA and Social Studies.
*   **Critical Source Evaluation:** Moving beyond basic credibility checks to analyzing author's perspective, purpose, bias, and rhetorical strategies in sources.
*   **Complex Problem Solving:** Tackling multi-step problems requiring strategic planning, application of multiple concepts, and evaluation of solutions across disciplines.
*   **Increased Self-Direction:** Greater expectation for independent learning, managing complex long-term projects, and utilizing metacognitive strategies.

title: Educator Knowledge Trees - Age 14 Capabilities
description: Defines the Pedagogical and Tautological knowledge trees outlining expected capabilities for a typical 14-year-old.
version: 1.0
date: 2025-04-13

# Age 14 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 14**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 14 (typically 8th or 9th Grade) often marks the transition to high school, requiring more complex analytical thinking, independent research, and preparation for specialized academic tracks.

**Reasoning for Age 14 Trees:**

*   **Foundation for Advanced Study:** Skills and knowledge are geared towards preparing for more specialized and rigorous high school courses (e.g., advanced math sequences, AP/IB preparatory work).
*   **Discipline-Specific Inquiry:** Increased emphasis on thinking and working within the specific methodologies of different academic disciplines (scientific method, historical analysis, literary criticism, mathematical proof - basic concepts).
*   **Complex Argumentation & Synthesis:** Constructing nuanced arguments, synthesizing information from multiple complex sources, and addressing counterarguments thoughtfully are key skills.
*   **Abstract Modeling & Representation:** Using abstract models (mathematical equations, scientific diagrams, historical frameworks) to represent and analyze complex phenomena becomes more common.
*   **Independent Research & Project Management:** Expectation to conduct more independent research, manage longer-term projects, and present findings effectively.
*   **Personalization & Choice:** Depending on the system, students might begin having more choices in their coursework (electives, language tracks), though core subjects remain central.

# Age 15 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 15**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 15 (typically 9th or 10th Grade) involves deeper engagement with specialized high school subjects, development of critical analysis, and beginning considerations for future academic or career paths.

**Reasoning for Age 15 Trees:**

*   **Disciplinary Depth & Specialization:** Students engage more deeply with the specific content and methodologies of core subjects like Chemistry, World History, Algebra II/Geometry. Electives offer opportunities for focused study.
*   **Analytical & Critical Thinking:** Emphasis shifts further towards critical analysis – evaluating sources, deconstructing arguments, interpreting complex data, analyzing literary techniques, and understanding historical context.
*   **Synthesis & Connection:** Expectation to synthesize information from multiple complex sources and make connections across different concepts, units, or even disciplines.
*   **Formal Argumentation:** Constructing well-structured, evidence-based arguments with clear reasoning and acknowledgment of nuances or counterarguments is crucial.
*   **Problem Solving Complexity:** Tackling more abstract and multi-step problems requiring sophisticated application of concepts and procedures, particularly in math and science.
*   **Preparation for Upper-Level Work:** Skills developed are essential for success in advanced high school courses (AP, IB, dual enrollment) and standardized tests (PSAT, SAT/ACT prep).

# Age 17 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 17**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

Age 17 (typically 11th or 12th Grade) is often focused on applying knowledge in complex ways, completing college applications or post-secondary plans, and demonstrating intellectual independence.

**Reasoning for Age 17 Trees:**

*   **Culmination & Mastery:** Expectation to demonstrate mastery in core subjects and chosen areas of specialization through advanced coursework, capstone projects, or comprehensive exams.
*   **Independent Application & Research:** Ability to independently design, execute, and present significant research or projects is highly valued.
*   **Critical Synthesis & Originality:** Moving beyond analysis to synthesizing diverse, complex information to formulate original arguments, interpretations, or solutions.
*   **Disciplinary Fluency:** Ability to think, communicate, and problem-solve using the methods and language of specific academic disciplines at a pre-collegiate level.
*   **Transition Readiness:** Possessing the academic skills (critical thinking, research, writing, quantitative reasoning) and self-management skills (time management, organization, self-advocacy) needed for college or career entry.
*   **Civic & Global Engagement:** Developing a more informed and critical perspective on complex societal and global issues, and understanding pathways for engagement.

# Reference Implementation: Azure .NET IT Helpdesk

This document outlines a reference architecture for implementing the Nucleus OmniRAG system specifically for an IT Helpdesk scenario, deployed within a Microsoft Azure environment using .NET technologies. It provides a specific implementation example for the general concepts described in the main [Professional Colleague Persona Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS_PROFESSIONAL.md).

## 1. High-Level Component Architecture

**Purpose:** Shows the major software components and their interactions within the Azure ecosystem for the Helpdesk use case.

    TeamsClient -- 14. Displays to User --> User

    DotNetBotFramework -- Reads Config --> AzureAppConfig
    DotNetProcessingSvc -- Reads Config --> AzureAppConfig
```

**Explanation:** This architecture uses Azure services. User interaction occurs via Teams, handled by a .NET Bot Framework bot and a Nucleus Teams Adapter. Queries and processing job triggers are published to Azure Service Bus Topics for asynchronous handling by a .NET Processing Service (potentially Azure Functions or a Worker Service running in Azure Container Apps). This service orchestrates ephemeral ingestion, interacts with the IT Helpdesk Persona module (which uses Azure OpenAI or similar for analysis), generates embeddings for derived snippets, and reads/writes metadata (`ArtifactMetadata`) and derived knowledge (`PersonaKnowledgeEntry`) to Azure Cosmos DB. Configuration is centrally managed via Azure App Configuration.

## 2. Key Architectural Characteristics

**Purpose:** Highlights the non-functional benefits and design principles of this specific implementation approach.

# Processing Architecture: Data Visualization ('Dataviz')

## 1. Overview

The Data Visualization (Dataviz) capability represents a "skill" that Nucleus OmniRAG Personas can invoke to present data-driven insights interactively to users within their client platform (e.g., Teams, Slack). It allows a Persona to dynamically generate small, interactive data visualizations powered by Python libraries (like Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib) running client-side via Pyodide.

This architecture emphasizes separation of concerns:

*   **Persona Responsibility:** Determines *that* a visualization is needed, *what* data to show, and *how* (via a Python code snippet) to visualize it. The Persona provides the semantic understanding and the core visualization logic.
*   **Platform Adapter Responsibility:** Handles the *mechanics* of generating the final visualization artifact (a self-contained HTML file) and delivering it to the user within the specific client platform's UI constraints (e.g., using a Teams Task Module).

The goal is to create rich, interactive, and contextually relevant data presentations directly within the user's workflow, leveraging the power of the Python data science ecosystem in a secure, sandboxed environment.

## 2. Triggering the Dataviz Skill

A Persona triggers the Dataviz skill by including specific instructions and data within its response payload after processing a user request or analyzing content (e.g., during `HandleQueryAsync` or `AnalyzeContentAsync`).

The Persona's response payload should indicate a desire to generate a visualization and must include:

1.  **Python Code Snippet:** A string containing Python code designed to run within the designated `### START AI GENERATED CODE ###` section of the Pyodide template. This snippet should perform the visualization logic using pre-imported libraries (e.g., `pandas as pd`, `plotly.express as px`) and assign the resulting figure object to a predefined variable (`final_fig_plotly` or `final_fig_matplotlib`).
2.  **JSON Data:** The data required by the Python snippet, formatted as a valid JSON object structure. This data will be made available to the Python script via the `js.jsonData` object in the template.
3.  **(Optional) Type Hint:** A hint indicating the primary library used (e.g., 'plotly', 'matplotlib') to assist the adapter in downstream processing or UI decisions.
4.  **(Optional) Title/Description:** A suggested title or description for the visualization.

## 3. Artifact Generation Process (`viz.html`)

Upon receiving a response payload containing a visualization request from a Persona, the **responsible Processing component** (implemented by the `Nucleus.Processing.Services.DatavizHtmlBuilder` class - see [`../../Nucleus.Processing/Services/DatavizHtmlBuilder.cs`](../../Nucleus.Processing/Services/DatavizHtmlBuilder.cs)) performs the following steps to generate the self-contained `viz.html` artifact:

1.  **Load Templates:** Reads the content of the standard template files (`dataviz_template.html`, `dataviz_styles.css`, `dataviz_script.js`, `dataviz_plotly_script.py`, `dataviz_worker.js`) located within the Processing service's resources.
2.  **Inject Python Script:**
    *   Retrieves the Python code snippet provided by the Persona.
    *   **Escapes** the snippet appropriately for embedding within a JavaScript multiline template literal (e.g., escaping backticks, backslashes, `${` sequences) within the `dataviz_script.js` content placeholder.
3.  **Inject JSON Data:**
    *   Retrieves the JSON data object provided by the Persona.
    *   Serializes the data into a JSON string if necessary.
    *   Injects the JSON string directly into the appropriate JavaScript placeholder within the `dataviz_script.js` content placeholder.
4.  **Assemble HTML:** Performs string replacements on the `dataviz_template.html` content:
    *   Injects the content of `dataviz_styles.css` into `{{CSS_STYLES}}`.
    *   Injects the modified `dataviz_script.js` content (containing the injected Python and JSON) into `{{MAIN_SCRIPT}}`.
    *   Injects the original Python script content into `{{PYTHON_SCRIPT}}` (for the code viewer modal).
    *   Injects the content of `dataviz_worker.js` into `{{WORKER_SCRIPT}}`.
    *   Injects the JSON data string into `{{JSON_DATA}}` (for the data viewer modal).
5.  **Output:** The result is a complete HTML content string (`finalHtml`) representing the `viz.html` artifact, ready to be passed to the Client Adapter for delivery.

## 4. The Dataviz Template Structure

The structure relies on several template files assembled at runtime by `DatavizHtmlBuilder`. See the [`ARCHITECTURE_DATAVIZ_TEMPLATE.md`](./Dataviz/ARCHITECTURE_DATAVIZ_TEMPLATE.md) document for a detailed breakdown of each file's role and content.

Key components within the assembled HTML:

*   **HTML Boilerplate:** Standard HTML5 structure.
*   **CDN Links:** `<script>` tags to load Pyodide and Plotly.js libraries.
*   **CSS:** Styling for loading indicators, output areas, error messages, export buttons, and modals.
*   **HTML Structure:** `div` elements for displaying loading status, the visualization output (`#output-area`), error messages (`#error-area`), export/view buttons, and modals.
*   **JavaScript Logic (`dataviz_script.js` Content):
    *   **Embedded Content:** Reads the Python script, JSON data, and worker script content from embedded `<script>` tags within the final HTML.
    *   **Pyodide Initialization:** Code to load the Pyodide runtime via a Web Worker created from a Blob URL derived from the embedded worker script content.
    *   **Worker Communication:** Uses `postMessage` to send the Python script and data to the worker and receive results.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Handles UI updates (loading, output, errors, modals).
    *   **Export/View Functions:** Event handlers for buttons (Export PNG/SVG/HTML, View Code/Data/Logs).
*   **Embedded Worker Script (`dataviz_worker.js` Content):
    *   Initializes Pyodide, installs required packages (like `micropip`).
    *   Receives Python code and JSON data via `onmessage`.
    *   Executes the Python code, providing access to the data.
    *   Uses `postMessage` to send results (or errors) back to the main thread.
*   **Embedded Python Script (`dataviz_plotly_script.py` Content):
    *   Provides the structure for the Python code executed by the worker.
    *   Includes standard imports (`pyodide_http`, `micropip`, `pandas`, `plotly.express`, etc.).
    *   Loads the JSON data passed from the worker's `onmessage` handler.
    *   Executes the specific visualization logic provided by the Persona.
    *   Assigns the result to a standard variable (e.g., `plotly_figure`).
    *   Renders the figure to HTML/JSON for sending back to the main thread.

## 5. Security Considerations

Security is handled through multiple layers inherent in the design:

*   **Sandboxing:** Pyodide runs within the WebAssembly sandbox, further constrained by the browser's iframe sandbox (configured by the adapter).
*   **Controlled Execution:** The Python code runs within a predefined template structure, limiting the scope of the AI-generated portion.
*   **No Direct DOM Access:** Python code communicates results back to JavaScript via `postMessage`; it doesn't directly manipulate the host page DOM.
*   **Web Worker Isolation:** Running Pyodide in a worker prevents long-running scripts from freezing the UI and allows the main thread to potentially terminate the worker if it exceeds a timeout.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** The adapter serving the `viz.html` must implement a strict CSP to control resource loading (scripts, styles) and prevent unauthorized network connections (`connect-src`).

## 6. Relationship to Client Adapters

While the *request* for a visualization originates from a Persona's analysis, and the **artifact generation** (populating the templates) occurs within the **Nucleus.Processing** layer, the **delivery mechanism** (e.g., Teams Task Modules, saving/displaying a file via the Console Adapter) resides within the **specific Client Adapter** (e.g., `Nucleus.Adapters.Teams`, `Nucleus.Adapters.Console`) responsible for the user interaction context. The Adapter receives the fully formed HTML string from the Processing layer and handles its presentation according to platform capabilities and APIs (like Graph API for potential temporary storage if needed for specific platform mechanisms).

# Processing Architecture: Ingestion

## 1. Overview

The Nucleus ingestion pipeline is responsible for receiving artifacts from client adapters, processing them into a canonical, **ephemeral full textual representation** where feasible, and creating structured `ArtifactMetadata` to track them. This process prioritizes preserving the complete context of the original artifact, preparing it for nuanced, LLM-driven analysis and salient snippet extraction during the retrieval phase.

It strategically employs Large Language Models (LLMs) with extensive context windows (e.g., 1M+ tokens via Google Gemini) *during* ingestion for tasks requiring common-sense reasoning or complex transformations, moving beyond simple text extraction where beneficial.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Create Full Textual Representations:** Maximize the capture of information from diverse sources into a canonical Markdown format *ephemerally* during processing.
*   **Leverage Large Context LLMs:** Utilize LLMs for common-sense processing, summarization, description generation (for multimedia), and synthesis *during* ingestion within the session scope.
*   **No Premature Chunking:** Generate the full Markdown representation first (ephemerally); chunking occurs later during retrieval based on query context.
*   **No Direct Embedding of Full Content:** Vector embeddings are generated by Personas based on *derived knowledge and salient snippets*, not the entire generated Markdown.
*   **Metadata is King:** Persistently store rich `ArtifactMetadata` (pointers to source, status) and `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` (structured knowledge, snippets, vectors) in Cosmos DB.
*   **Ephemeral Processing Scope:** All intermediate representations (like extracted text, generated Markdown) exist *only* within the memory/ephemeral container storage scope of a single user request/session. Nucleus does not persistently store this generated content, relying instead on fetching fresh source data via Adapters for each session to ensure data freshness and minimize privacy risks.
*   **Processors Produce Ephemeral Outputs for Personas:** Processors like Plaintext and Multimedia generate ephemeral representations (Markdown, descriptions) consumed immediately by Persona processors within the same session.

## 3. High-Level Flow (Per User Request/Session)

1.  **Artifact Identification:** Based on user request context (e.g., shared file URI, query keywords), identify potentially relevant source artifacts. This may involve querying `ArtifactMetadata` in Cosmos DB for previously seen sources.
2.  **Fetch Fresh Source:** Use the appropriate `Client Adapter` to retrieve the *current version* of the identified source artifact(s).
3.  **Initial Dispatch:** Send the fresh source artifact to the main ingestion dispatcher.
4.  **Processor Chain (Ephemeral):**
    *   The dispatcher routes the artifact through the relevant processors (e.g., FileCollection -> Multimedia -> Plaintext; or PDF Processor -> Plaintext).
    *   Each processor performs its task, generating intermediate outputs (e.g., extracted components, descriptions, synthesized Markdown) that exist **ephemerally** (in memory or temporary local files).
    *   The final **ephemeral Markdown** representation is produced by the Plaintext processor.
5.  **Persona Analysis:** The ephemeral Markdown is passed to the relevant `Persona` processor(s).
6.  **Knowledge Extraction & Persistence:** Personas analyze the Markdown, extract structured data, identify salient snippets, generate vector embeddings *for those snippets/data*, and store/update `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records in Cosmos DB.
7.  **Update Metadata:** Update the `ArtifactMetadata` record in Cosmos DB for the source artifact, indicating processing status per persona.
8.  **Cleanup:** Ephemeral representations (like the full Markdown) are discarded at the end of the session/request processing.
9.  **(Query Phase):** Retrieval mechanisms query `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` in Cosmos DB for relevant snippets/structured data to synthesize a response.

## 4. Performance, Cost, and Caching

The strategy of processing full documents relies heavily on the capabilities of the underlying LLM provider:

*   **Large Context Windows (1M+ Tokens):** Essential for providing the LLM with sufficient context (full document text + conversational history) for high-quality extraction and processing.
*   **Low Cost:** Affordable per-token pricing (e.g., Gemini's ~$0.10-$0.20 per million tokens) makes large-context operations financially viable.
*   **Context Caching:** Crucially, leveraging API-level context caching mechanisms allows the cost and latency of processing a large document to be amortized. After the initial processing (which populates the cache), subsequent LLM interactions involving the same document context become significantly faster and cheaper.

This combination enables the high-quality, context-preserving approach central to Nucleus OmniRAG.

## 5. Specific Format Processors

Details for handling specific formats are documented separately:

*   [Plaintext Files](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md)
*   *Others TBD (e.g., PDF, Office, Image, Audio, Code, Zip)*

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Processing Orchestration Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Orchestration** sub-domain within the overall [Processing Architecture](../01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md). Orchestration is concerned with managing the *flow* of work required to handle user interactions and related background processing tasks.

While the [Ingestion](./Ingestion/ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md) components focus on transforming raw artifacts into usable representations, and [Personas](../02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md) focus on analyzing content and generating responses, Orchestration bridges the gap by coordinating the sequence of events, routing requests, and managing the execution context.

Key goals of the orchestration layer include:
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring interactions are processed correctly and consistently.
*   **Scalability:** Handling varying loads of concurrent interactions.
*   **Decoupling:** Separating concerns between triggering, routing, execution, and response delivery.
*   **Observability:** Providing visibility into the flow of work.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

The Orchestration layer encompasses several key responsibilities:

*   **Request Triggering & Context Initiation:**
    *   Monitoring triggers (e.g., messages on Pub/Sub subscriptions, API calls).
    *   Interpreting trigger information to understand the required action.
    *   Deciding when to initiate a new processing context (e.g., creating an instance of `IPersonaInteractionContext`).
    *   **Details:** See [Session Initiation](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md).
*   **Routing & Dispatching:**
    *   Determining the appropriate handler (e.g., specific Persona, ingestion processor) based on trigger metadata, user context, or configuration.
    *   Directing the interaction context or processing task to the correct handler.
    *   **Details:** See [Routing & Salience](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md).
*   **Interaction Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Executing the defined steps for processing a single user interaction, from context hydration to response generation.
    *   **Details:** See [Interaction Processing Lifecycle](./Orchestration/ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md).
*   **State Management:**
    *   Managing any necessary state related to the *flow* of complex or long-running operations (Note: distinct from the ephemeral nature of individual interaction processing).
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   Implementing strategies for handling failures during orchestration steps (e.g., retries, compensating actions, logging, alerting).

## 3. Relationship to Other Components

*   **Client Adapters:** Orchestration relies on adapters to provide the necessary context during the hydration phase of the interaction lifecycle.
*   **Messaging Queues:** Often used as the primary trigger mechanism for initiating orchestration flows.
*   **Processing Components (Ingestion, Personas):** Orchestration dispatches work to these components.
*   **Compute Runtime:** The orchestration logic typically runs within the chosen compute environment (e.g., ACA, Functions).

## 4. Future Considerations

As the system matures (e.g., towards [Phase 4 Maturity Requirements](../../Requirements/04_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE4_MATURITY.md#32-workflow-orchestration)), the orchestration layer may evolve to use more sophisticated tools like dedicated workflow engines (e.g., Azure Durable Functions, Dapr Workflows) to handle more complex, stateful, or long-running processes beyond the simple background task model.

# Delivering AI-Generated Pyodide Visualizations in Teams via Self-Contained HTML Artifacts

## 1. Introduction

This report details an architecture for generating and delivering interactive, AI-driven data visualizations within Microsoft Teams, based on the concepts outlined in the [Data Visualization Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_DATAVIZ.md). It builds upon the previous analysis, incorporating the requirements for:

1. **Self-Contained Artifact:** Generating a single `viz.html` file containing all necessary HTML, CSS (branded), JavaScript, the AI-generated Python script, and the associated data.
2. **Teams/SharePoint Storage:** Storing this `viz.html` file as a persistent artifact within the relevant Team's SharePoint document library (specifically in a `.Nucleus/Artifacts/` folder).
3. **Task Module Delivery:** Using a Teams Task Module (Dialog) to present the interactive visualization to the user, launched from a bot message.
4. **Integrated Hosting:** Minimizing external dependencies by integrating the necessary components for delivering the HTML content to the Task Module within the C# Bot Framework application itself, aiming for a single deployable unit.

The core idea is to leverage the C# bot to orchestrate the creation and storage of a fully functional, interactive HTML visualization file, and then reliably deliver its content for rendering within the Teams UI.

## 2. Core Artifact: The `viz.html` Template

The foundation of this approach is a set of template files that the C# [`DatavizHtmlBuilder`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Services/DatavizHtmlBuilder.cs) populates. These templates include placeholders for branding, the Python script, and the data, along with the necessary JavaScript to load Pyodide and render the visualization.

The key template files involved are:

*   **[`dataviz_template.html`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Resources/Dataviz/dataviz_template.html):**
    *   Provides the main HTML structure (`<head>`, `<body>`).
    *   Includes CDN links for Pyodide and Plotly.
    *   Defines `div` elements for loading indicators, plot output, errors, buttons, and modals.
    *   Contains placeholders (`{{PLACEHOLDER}}`) where the builder injects CSS, the main script, the worker script, the original Python script (for viewing), and the JSON data (for viewing).

*   **[`dataviz_styles.css`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Resources/Dataviz/dataviz_styles.css):**
    *   Contains all CSS rules for styling the page elements, including layout, fonts, colors, and modal appearance.
    *   This content is injected directly into a `<style>` tag within the final HTML's `<head>` by the builder.

*   **[`dataviz_script.js`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Resources/Dataviz/dataviz_script.js):**
    *   Handles the primary client-side logic.
    *   Reads the embedded Python script, JSON data, and worker script from `<script>` tags placed in the final HTML by the builder.
    *   Initializes the Pyodide Web Worker.
    *   Manages communication (`postMessage`/`onmessage`) with the worker.
    *   Updates the DOM to show loading status, plot output, or errors.
    *   Contains event listeners for the export/view buttons and modal logic.
    *   Handles plot resizing logic using `ResizeObserver`.

*   **[`dataviz_worker.js`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Resources/Dataviz/dataviz_worker.js):**
    *   Runs in a separate Web Worker thread.
    *   Imports and initializes the Pyodide engine.
    *   Installs necessary Python packages (e.g., `micropip`, `plotly`, `pandas`).
    *   Receives the specific Python code snippet and JSON data from the main script via `onmessage`.
    *   Executes the Python code, making the data available to it.
    *   Sends the results (rendered plot HTML/SVG or error messages) back to the main script via `postMessage`.

*   **[`dataviz_plotly_script.py`](../../../Nucleus.Processing/Resources/Dataviz/dataviz_plotly_script.py):**
    *   Provides the standard Python environment structure that runs inside the Pyodide worker.
    *   Includes common imports (`js`, `json`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
    *   Contains helper functions (e.g., `render_plotly_to_div_string`, `render_matplotlib_to_svg_string`).
    *   Includes boilerplate code to load the `jsonData` passed from JavaScript into a pandas DataFrame.
    *   Defines the placeholder area (`### START AI GENERATED CODE ###`...`### END AI GENERATED CODE ###`) where the specific visualization code provided by the Persona is executed.
    *   Captures the output figure (`final_fig_plotly` or `final_fig_matplotlib`) and prepares it for sending back to the main JavaScript thread.

This modular template approach allows the `DatavizHtmlBuilder` to assemble a complete, functional visualization artifact by combining these standard parts with the dynamic content (Python code, JSON data) provided by an AI Persona.

## 3. Backend Implementation (C# Bot Framework Application)

The C# bot application (deployable as a single Azure App Service or Container App) handles the orchestration.

### 3.1. Artifact Generation:

C#

```csharp
using System.Text;
using System.Text.Json; // Requires System.Text.Json nuget package
using System.Text.RegularExpressions; // For escaping

//... within your bot logic (e.g., inside a Dialog or Activity Handler)

// 1. Load the HTML template content
string templateHtml = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("./path/to/your/template.html"); // Adjust path

// 2. Get Branding CSS (e.g., from config)
string brandingCss = "/* Your custom CSS rules here */\n.plotly-graph-div { border: 1px solid #ccc; }"; // Example

// 3. Get AI-generated Python code snippet and JSON data
string aiPythonSnippet = @"
# Example AI code:
final_fig_plotly = px.histogram(data_frame, x=data_frame.columns, title='AI Histogram')
js.pyodideWorker.postMessage({ type: 'progress', payload: 0.6 });
"; // Replace with actual AI output

object aiDataObject = new { // Replace with actual data structure
    data = new {
        new { category = "A", value = 10 },
        new { category = "B", value = 25 },
        new { category = "C", value = 15 }
    },
    metadata = new { title = "Sample Data" }
};
string aiJsonDataString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(aiDataObject, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });

// 4. Inject into template
string finalHtml = templateHtml;

// Inject CSS
finalHtml = finalHtml.Replace("", brandingCss);

// Inject Python (escape backticks, backslashes, ${} for JS template literals)
string escapedPythonSnippet = aiPythonSnippet
   .Replace("\\", "\\\\") // Escape backslashes
   .Replace("`", "\\`")  // Escape backticks
   .Replace("${", "\\${"); // Escape ${ sequence
finalHtml = finalHtml.Replace("### START AI GENERATED CODE ###", "### START AI GENERATED CODE ###\n" + escapedPythonSnippet); // Inject within markers

// Inject JSON data
finalHtml = finalHtml.Replace("/* JSON_DATA_PLACEHOLDER */ {}", $"/* JSON_DATA_PLACEHOLDER */ {aiJsonDataString}");

// 'finalHtml' string now contains the complete, ready-to-use HTML content
```

### 3.2. SharePoint Storage (using Microsoft.Graph SDK):

- **Permissions:** Ensure your bot's Azure AD App Registration has `Sites.Selected` Graph API permission (Application type) granted by an admin. Then, grant specific Write permissions to the bot's service principal for the target SharePoint site(s) using the `/sites/{site-id}/permissions` endpoint (this usually requires a separate script or process run by an admin).
- **C# Code Snippet:**

C#

```csharp
using Microsoft.Graph;
using Microsoft.Graph.Models;
using Azure.Identity; // For authentication
using System.IO;
using System.Text;

//... (Assuming you have GraphServiceClient initialized, e.g., 'graphClient')
//... (Assuming you have 'teamId' or 'groupId' for the context)

async Task StoreArtifactInSharePoint(GraphServiceClient graphClient, string groupId, string uniqueId, string htmlContent)
{
    try
    {
        // 1. Get the Team's root site
        var site = await graphClient.Groups[groupId].Sites["root"].GetAsync();
        if (site?.Id == null) throw new Exception("Could not find root site for group.");

        // 2. Get the default document library (Drive)
        var drive = await graphClient.Sites[site.Id].Drive.GetAsync();
        if (drive?.Id == null) throw new Exception("Could not find default drive for site.");

        // 3. Define the target path and filename
        string fileName = $"viz-{uniqueId}.html";
        string targetFolderPath = ".Nucleus/Artifacts"; // Ensure this folder exists or handle creation
        string targetPath = $"{targetFolderPath}/{fileName}"; // Relative to drive root

        // 4. Prepare the content stream
        byte htmlBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(htmlContent);
        using var contentStream = new MemoryStream(htmlBytes);

        // 5. Upload the file
        // PUT /drives/{drive.Id}/items/root:/{targetPath}:/content
        var uploadedItem = await graphClient.Drives[drive.Id].Items["root"].ItemWithPath(targetPath).Content.PutAsync(contentStream);

        if (uploadedItem!= null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Artifact stored successfully: {uploadedItem.WebUrl}");
            // Optionally return uploadedItem.WebUrl or ID
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to store artifact in SharePoint.");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error storing artifact in SharePoint: {ex.Message}");
        // Handle error appropriately
    }
}

// --- Usage ---
// string uniqueVizId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
// await StoreArtifactInSharePoint(graphClient, teamId, uniqueVizId, finalHtml);
```

### 3.3. Task Module Delivery & Integrated Hosting:

- **Caching:** Use `IMemoryCache` for simplicity and alignment with ephemeral processing goals. If performance in a multi-instance deployment *absolutely requires* shared state (which should generally be avoided), an external cache like Redis could be considered, but in-memory is strongly preferred.

C#

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory; // Add NuGet package

//... inject IMemoryCache cache...

// Store HTML in cache
string vizId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
cache.Set(vizId, finalHtml, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15)); // Cache for 15 mins

// --- In Bot Activity Handler (e.g., OnMessageActivityAsync) ---
// Send card with button like this:
var card = new HeroCard
{
    Title = "Visualization Ready",
    Text = "Click below to view the interactive visualization.",
    Buttons = new List<CardAction> {
        new TaskModuleAction("View Interactive", new { msteams = new { type = "task/fetch" }, data = new { vizId = vizId } })
        // Optionally add a direct link to the SharePoint file if stored
        // new CardAction(ActionTypes.OpenUrl, "View Artifact File", value: sharePointFileWebUrl)
    }
};
await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(card.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);


// --- In Bot Adapter or Controller (handle task/fetch) ---
// Implement OnTeamsTaskModuleFetchAsync or similar logic
protected override async Task<TaskModuleResponse> OnTeamsTaskModuleFetchAsync(ITurnContext<IInvokeActivity> turnContext, TaskModuleRequest taskModuleRequest, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var data = JObject.FromObject(taskModuleRequest.Data);
    string fetchedVizId = data["vizId"]?.ToString();

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(fetchedVizId) && cache.TryGetValue(fetchedVizId, out string _)) // Check if ID is valid and in cache
    {
        // Construct URL to the endpoint within *this* bot application
        // Ensure your bot's base URL is correctly configured (e.g., from settings)
        string renderUrl = $"{_botBaseUrl}/api/renderViz?id={fetchedVizId}";

        return new TaskModuleResponse
        {
            Task = new TaskModuleContinueResponse
            {
                Value = new TaskModuleTaskInfo
                {
                    Url = renderUrl,
                    Height = 600, // Adjust size as needed
                    Width = 800,
                    Title = "Interactive Visualization"
                }
            }
        };
    }
    // Handle error: vizId not found or invalid
    //... return error task module...
}

// --- Add Minimal API Endpoint in Program.cs (or a Controller) ---
// In your Bot's Program.cs or Startup.cs
//... other services...
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache(); // Add memory cache service

var app = builder.Build();

//... other middleware...

// Endpoint to serve the cached HTML
app.MapGet("/api/renderViz", (string id, IMemoryCache cache, ILogger<Program> logger) =>
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(id) && cache.TryGetValue(id, out string htmlContent))
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Serving visualization content for ID: {id}");
        // Set CSP Header - IMPORTANT!
        // Adjust directives as needed based on libraries and security posture
        var cspHeader = "default-src 'none'; " +
                        "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/ https://cdn.plot.ly/; " +
                        "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; " +
                        "img-src 'self' data:; " +
                        "font-src * data:; " + // Allow fonts from anywhere + data URIs
                        "connect-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://pypi.org https://files.pythonhosted.org; " + // Allow connections to Pyodide/micropip
                        "worker-src 'self' blob:; " + // Allow worker scripts from self and blob URLs
                        "frame-ancestors https://teams.microsoft.com https://*.teams.microsoft.com https://*.cloud.microsoft;"; // Allow embedding in Teams

        return Results.Content(htmlContent, "text/html", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)
                     .WithHeader("Content-Security-Policy", cspHeader);
    }
    else
    {
        logger.LogWarning($"Visualization content not found or expired for ID: {id}");
        return Results.NotFound("Visualization not found or has expired.");
    }
});

// Map bot framework adapter endpoint (e.g., /api/messages)
//...

app.Run();
```

## 4. Security Considerations

- **Python Template:** The strict structure, pre-defined imports, and clear AI code boundaries are crucial.
- **CSP Header:** The `Content-Security-Policy` header set by the `/api/renderViz` endpoint is vital for mitigating XSS, restricting network connections, and ensuring the content can only be framed by Teams. **Crucially, for Pyodide/micropip to download packages, the `connect-src` directive MUST include `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `https://pypi.org`, and `https://files.pythonhosted.org`. Additionally, `script-src` needs `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'`, and the CDNs (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `https://cdn.plot.ly`), while `worker-src` requires `blob:` for the Pyodide worker.**
- **Web Worker:** Isolates Pyodide execution, preventing UI freezes and enabling potential timeouts (though explicit timeout logic isn't shown in the snippet, it can be added around the worker interaction).
- **Graph Permissions:** Use `Sites.Selected` for least privilege access to SharePoint.
- **Input Validation:** The bot backend should ideally perform basic validation on the AI-generated Python snippet (e.g., checking for obviously malicious patterns, though this is hard) and the size/structure of the JSON data before generating the final HTML.

## 5. Deployment

The C# Bot Framework application, now containing the bot logic (`/api/messages`), artifact generation, SharePoint upload logic, caching (`IMemoryCache` preferred), and the HTML serving endpoint (`/api/renderViz`), can be deployed as a single unit to Azure App Service or Azure Container Apps. Ensure the service has network access to Microsoft Graph. External caching (like Redis) should generally be avoided but may require network configuration if deemed strictly necessary.

## 6. Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust method for delivering AI-generated, interactive Python visualizations within Teams. It creates a self-contained, branded HTML artifact stored persistently in SharePoint, while ensuring reliable interactive delivery via a Task Module powered by an integrated endpoint within the bot application itself. This approach balances functionality, security, and deployment simplicity.

# Ingestion Architecture: File Collections (e.g., Zip Archives)

## 1. Role and Overview

The File Collections processor handles artifacts that represent containers holding multiple individual files, such as Zip archives (`.zip`), Tarballs (`.tar.gz`, `.tgz`), or potentially other package formats. Its primary goal is to unpack the container and recursively process each constituent file using the appropriate ingestion processor ([Plaintext](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md), [Multimedia](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md), etc.), ensuring that the relationships between the container and its contents are preserved in the metadata.

This processor adheres to the overall ingestion principles ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md)) by ensuring each contained file ultimately results in a faithful textual representation stored without premature chunking.

## 2. Processing Steps

1.  **Receive Collection:** Accepts the container artifact (e.g., zip file stream/bytes).
2.  **Create Container Metadata Stub:** Creates an initial `ArtifactMetadata` record for the container artifact itself (e.g., the zip file). This marks the container as 'Processing'.
3.  **Unpack Contents:** Extracts the constituent files from the container into a temporary location.
4.  **Process Multimedia & Collect Components:** Iterates through the extracted files:
    *   **If Multimedia:** Dispatches to the **Multimedia** processor ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_MULTIMEDIA.md)). Waits for the LLM-generated text description and stores it temporarily (in memory or temp variable).
    *   **If Text/XML/Relevant:** Reads the file content into a temporary variable (e.g., reads `word/document.xml` content).
    *   Collects all relevant raw text/XML content strings and all generated multimedia description strings.
5.  **Dispatch Bundle for Synthesis:** Bundles *all* collected relevant XML/text content strings and *all* generated multimedia descriptions together. Dispatches this entire bundle to the **Plaintext Processor** ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md)) with a specific instruction (e.g., "Synthesize a single coherent Markdown document representing the original container artifact from these components").
6.  **Await Synthesized Markdown & Update Metadata:** Waits for the Plaintext processor to return the synthesized Markdown content. Updates the *original container's* `ArtifactMetadata` record to point directly to this synthesized Markdown content and marks the container's overall processing state as completed.
7.  **Cleanup:** Removes the temporarily extracted files and intermediate component data.

## 3. Key Principles & Considerations

*   **Component Aggregation:** This processor acts primarily as an unpacker and aggregator of textual components (original text/XML + generated descriptions).
*   **Delegated Synthesis:** The complex task of synthesizing a final document from components is delegated to the Plaintext processor's LLM.
*   **Metadata Simplicity:** Focuses on linking the original container artifact directly to the synthesized Markdown content. Intermediate components might not have persistent metadata.
*   **LLM Dependency:** The quality of the synthesized output heavily depends on the Plaintext processor's LLM's ability to interpret the bundled components and synthesis instructions correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Needs robust handling for corrupted archives, errors during multimedia processing, and potential failures during the final LLM synthesis step.
*   **Nested Collections:** Can still handle nested archives by recursively invoking itself, but the final synthesis step happens at each level for the components within that specific container.
*   **Resource Limits:** Still needs to manage resources for unpacking and holding intermediate components in memory/ephemeral container storage before the final synthesis dispatch.

This processor ensures complex container artifacts are deconstructed, their essential textual/visual information is captured (via raw text or LLM descriptions), and then intelligently re-synthesized into a single, coherent Markdown representation by the Plaintext processor's LLM.

## 4. Example: Processing a Word Document (.docx)

Microsoft Word `.docx` files illustrate this LLM-centric synthesis approach:

The processing flow:

1.  **Receipt & Dispatch:** `.docx` received, identified as a File Collection, dispatched to this processor.
2.  **Container Metadata:** Stub created for the `.docx` file.
3.  **Unpack:** Archive unpacked:
    *   `word/document.xml`
    *   `word/styles.xml`
    *   `word/media/image1.png`
    *   `word/media/image2.jpg`
    *   ...etc.
4.  **Process Multimedia & Collect Components:**
    *   `image1.png` -> Multimedia Processor -> LLM -> Returns `description1_text`.
    *   `image2.jpg` -> Multimedia Processor -> LLM -> Returns `description2_text`.
    *   Reads content of `document.xml` into `doc_xml_content` string.
    *   Reads content of `styles.xml` into `styles_xml_content` string.
    *   (Other relevant XML/text components collected similarly).
5.  **Dispatch Bundle for Synthesis:** Sends a bundle containing (`doc_xml_content`, `styles_xml_content`, ..., `description1_text`, `description2_text`) to the **Plaintext Processor** with instruction: "Synthesize Markdown for Word doc from this XML and image descriptions."
6.  **Await Synthesized Markdown & Update Metadata:** Plaintext processor uses its LLM with the bundle, generates synthesized Markdown content, and passes it back. The `.docx` container's `ArtifactMetadata` is updated to point directly to this synthesized Markdown content and marked complete.
7.  **Cleanup:** Temporary files and component strings deleted.

**Outcome:** The single `.docx` artifact is now represented by its metadata record pointing directly to **synthesized Markdown content**, intelligently generated by an LLM from the original document's core XML structure and LLM-generated descriptions of its embedded images. This synthesized Markdown content is now the basis for search and retrieval.

This LLM-driven synthesis approach radically simplifies the pipeline by avoiding dedicated Office parsers, fully embracing the "common sense engine" capability of modern LLMs operating on large context windows.

description: Describes the conversion of multimedia files, grounded against substantial background context, into a canonical, faithful, and complete textual representation.
version: 1.0

# Ingestion Architecture: Multimedia Files (Image, Audio, Video)

## 1. Role and Overview

The Multimedia File processor handles non-textual artifacts like images, audio files, and potentially video. It adheres to the core ingestion principles ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md)) by converting these formats into a **rich, contextually grounded textual representation** suitable for downstream LLM analysis and retrieval.

This process leverages advanced multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Google Gemini, capable of interpreting visual and auditory information directly.

## 2. Core Strategy: Context-Grounded LLM Conversion

Instead of relying solely on traditional methods (e.g., basic OCR, simple transcription), this processor uses LLMs as a "common sense engine" to generate text that captures the salient aspects of the multimedia content *within the context* it was provided.

## 3. Processing Steps

1.  **Receive Multimedia & Context:** Accepts the multimedia artifact (bytes/stream) and crucial grounding context. This context may include:
    *   Source Metadata: Filename, timestamps, creator, related artifact IDs.
    *   Conversational Context: Relevant parts of the user interaction where the artifact was shared, explicit user goals.
    *   Task Directives: Specific instructions like "Describe the trends in this chart image," or "Summarize the key decisions in this meeting audio."
2.  **Prepare LLM Prompt:** Constructs a prompt for the multimodal LLM, combining the grounding context (as text) with the multimedia data itself.
3.  **LLM Invocation:** Calls the appropriate multimodal LLM API (e.g., Gemini) with the prepared prompt and multimedia data. Leverage API features like **Context Caching** where applicable for efficiency.
4.  **Receive Textual Representation:** The LLM returns a generated text string (e.g., a detailed image description, a structured meeting summary from audio, a scene description from video).
5.  **Dispatch to Downstream Processing:** If transcription is successful, pass the generated text downstream for further processing (e.g., by the Plaintext processor or directly to persona analysis if simple enough).
6.  **Metadata Finalization:** Updates the `ArtifactMetadata` record, ensuring it includes:
    *   Link/URI to the original multimedia file (which might be stored separately or discarded depending on policy).
    *   Metadata indicating the source type (image, audio, video) and that the text is a generated representation.
    *   Any relevant structured data extracted or inferred by the LLM during conversion.

## 4. Key Principles & Considerations

*   **Maximizes Context:** The quality of the generated text heavily depends on the richness of the grounding context provided to the LLM.
*   **Leverages LLM Strengths:** Offloads the complex task of multimedia interpretation to the LLM, benefiting from its common-sense reasoning.
*   **No Native Chunking:** The generated text is processed whole, adhering to the principle of avoiding premature chunking. Subsequent retrieval operates on this full generated text.
*   **Potential for Iteration:** Future versions might involve iterative refinement with the LLM if the initial generated text is insufficient.
*   **Cost/Latency:** Relies on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the chosen multimodal LLM provider. Caching is vital.
*   **Video Processing:** Video might be handled by sampling frames (as images) and/or processing the audio track, potentially combining results via another LLM call.

## 5. Output

The resulting text content is passed on, either as a standalone `ContentItem` or potentially aggregated by a later processor (like File Collections) if part of a larger artifact bundle.

This approach ensures that valuable information within multimedia artifacts is transformed into a usable textual format, deeply integrated with the surrounding context, and ready for inclusion in Nucleus OmniRAG's knowledge base.

# Architecture: PDF Ingestion

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-13

This document outlines the ingestion strategy for Portable Document Format (PDF) files within the Nucleus OmniRAG architecture. PDFs represent a unique challenge due to their complex, fixed-layout nature, potentially containing a mix of structured text, raster images (requiring OCR), vector graphics, forms, and annotations. They are not inherently structured as archives of simple components like Office Open XML formats.

The strategy aims to balance the core principles of simplicity and leveraging LLMs with the practical need to reliably extract content from this often-difficult format.

## 1. Core Challenge

Directly applying the "bundle components + LLM synthesis" pattern used for File Collections (like `.docx`) is not feasible for PDFs because:

*   PDFs lack a standardized, easily extractable internal component structure comparable to OOXML.
*   Content extraction often requires specialized parsing libraries and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
*   Layout information is critical to meaning but hard to capture reliably.

## 2. Processing Strategy: Hybrid Approach

Nucleus employs a two-pronged, configurable approach based on the PDF's characteristics (size, complexity) and the capabilities of available LLMs:

**Attempt 1: Direct Multimodal LLM Processing (Preferred)**

*   **Trigger:** PDF artifact detected, and its size/complexity (e.g., page count) is *below* a configured threshold.
*   **Mechanism:** The raw PDF file bytes (or potentially rendered images of its pages) are sent directly to a capable multimodal LLM (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **Prompt:** The LLM is instructed to:
    *   Analyze the PDF structure and layout.
    *   Extract text content.
    *   Perform OCR on embedded images if necessary and possible.
    *   Interpret the overall document.
    *   Generate a **single, coherent Markdown document** that best represents the original PDF's content and structure.
*   **Outcome:** If the LLM successfully processes the PDF and returns satisfactory Markdown:
    *   **Next Step:** The LLM-generated Markdown is passed directly to the standard **Plaintext Processor** ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md)) for final storage.

**Attempt 2: External Pre-processing (Fallback)**

*   **Trigger:** PDF artifact detected, and:
    *   Its size/complexity exceeds the configured threshold for direct LLM processing, OR
    *   The direct LLM attempt (Attempt 1) fails, times out, or produces clearly inadequate results.
*   **Mechanism:** The ingestion pipeline invokes a dedicated, **external** pre-processing service. This service is specifically designed for robust PDF parsing.
    *   *Example Implementation:* An Azure Function App container running a library like `Pandoc`, `PyMuPDF`, `pdfminer.six`, or a commercial PDF SDK.
*   **Pre-processor Task:** The external service performs the heavy lifting:
    *   Parses the PDF structure.
    *   Extracts text blocks, preserving reading order where possible.
    *   Performs OCR on images.
    *   Converts the extracted content into a simplified intermediate format, typically **basic Markdown or plain text**.
*   **Outcome:** The external pre-processor returns the extracted text/Markdown content.
    *   **Next Step:** This intermediate output is passed to the standard **Plaintext Processor** ([ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md](./ARCHITECTURE_INGESTION_PLAINTEXT.md)) for potential minor cleanup and final storage as canonical Markdown.

## 3. Integration with Core Pipeline

Crucially, regardless of whether the PDF is processed via direct LLM or an external pre-processor, the final step is **always** passing the resulting text/Markdown to the **Plaintext Processor**. This ensures:

*   The core ingestion flow remains consistent.
*   The final artifact stored and linked in `ArtifactMetadata` is always the canonical Markdown representation.
*   Downstream processes (retrieval, analysis) interact with a uniform data type.

## 4. Configuration and Considerations

*   **Thresholds:** The decision boundary (file size, page count) between Attempt 1 and Attempt 2 must be configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is needed for both paths (LLM failures, pre-processor failures, corrupted PDFs).
*   **External Dependency:** Acknowledges the introduction of an optional, external pre-processing service, requiring separate deployment, maintenance, and cost considerations. This is deemed a necessary complexity trade-off specifically for robust PDF handling.
*   **Pre-processor Choice:** The specific library/tool used in the external pre-processor can be chosen based on required features, performance, and licensing.

## 5. Key Principles Summary

This hybrid strategy adheres to the core principles:

*   **Simplicity First:** Attempts the simplest path (direct LLM) when feasible.
*   **Leverage LLM:** Uses the LLM's multimodal capabilities for direct interpretation when possible.
*   **Pragmatism:** Falls back to a specialized external tool for cases exceeding current LLM limitations or requiring deeper parsing.
*   **Architectural Separation:** Keeps the specialized, complex PDF parsing logic *external* to the core Nucleus ingestion processors.
*   **Canonical Markdown:** Ensures the final persisted output is always standardized Markdown via the Plaintext Processor.

# Ingestion Architecture: Plaintext Files

## 1. Role and Overview

The Plaintext File processor is the universal endpoint for textual content within the ingestion pipeline ([ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_INGESTION.md)). It receives textual data from various sources:

*   Naturally text-based files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, source code files).
*   The textual output streams generated by other processors (e.g., LLM-generated image descriptions, audio transcriptions, text extracted from PDF/Office documents, raw XML from Office files).

Its core responsibility is to **convert the incoming textual data into a canonical, structured ephemeral Markdown representation**, and then ensure the **faithful and complete consumption** of this final Markdown output by downstream Persona processors.

## 2. Processing Steps

1.  **Receive Text Input:** Accepts input as:
    *   A single text stream or string with format hints (e.g., `source=xml`).
    *   **A bundle of multiple related text streams/strings** (e.g., XML components + LLM descriptions from an unpacked file collection) along with a **synthesis instruction** (e.g., "Synthesize a coherent Markdown document from these components representing the original source artifact").
2.  **Convert/Synthesize to Structured Markdown:**
    *   **Single Input:** If receiving a single input, convert it to Markdown as previously described (e.g., using libraries or LLM for complex formatting).
    *   **Bundle Input (Synthesis):** If receiving a bundle and a synthesis instruction:
        *   Construct a large prompt for the configured LLM (e.g., Gemini).
        *   Include the synthesis instruction, all provided textual components (XMLs, descriptions, etc.), and any relevant context (original container filename, etc.).
        *   Invoke the LLM, relying on its large context window and common-sense reasoning to interpret the relationships between the components (e.g., OOXML structure) and generate **one single, coherent, well-structured Markdown document** representing the original artifact.
3.  **Minimal Cleanup (Optional):** Perform final normalization on the generated/synthesized Markdown.
4.  **Return Ephemeral Markdown:** Provides the generated, canonical Markdown content (as a string or stream) to the next stage in the processing pipeline (typically a Persona processor).
5.  **Provide Context for Metadata:** Contributes information *relevant* to the final `ArtifactMetadata` record (e.g., confirming successful text processing, potentially identifying a title), but does not perform the final metadata update or link to persisted content (as there is none).

## 3. Key Principles

*   **Canonical Format = Markdown:** This processor's output is *always* structured Markdown.
*   **Ephemeral Output:** The generated Markdown is transient and consumed immediately by downstream Persona processors.
*   **No Chunking:** The final ephemeral Markdown output is passed *whole* to Personas.
*   **No Embedding:** Vector embeddings are not generated here.
*   **No Semantic Interpretation:** While it restructures text into Markdown, it does not analyze the meaning or extract entities beyond what's needed for formatting.
*   **Idempotency:** Given the same input text and format hint, it should consistently produce the same Markdown output. **Note on Idempotency:** The system determines whether an artifact needs processing based on its *source* identifiers (`sourceIdentifier`, possibly source hash/timestamp) and context (e.g., Persona version), *not* by hashing the variable Markdown output of the LLM. Processing the same source may yield slightly different Markdown, which is acceptable.

This processor ensures that all ingested textual information, regardless of its original form, is normalized into a consistent, high-quality Markdown format, providing a standardized foundation for the downstream retrieval and salient snippet extraction process.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Interaction Processing Lifecycle

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the end-to-end lifecycle of processing a single user interaction within the Nucleus OmniRAG system. This process typically occurs within the containerized compute runtime (e.g., Azure Container Apps, Docker) as outlined in the [Deployment Abstractions](../Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md#2-asynchronous-messaging-pubsub). It bridges the gap between an external user request arriving via a [Client Adapter](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md) and the final response generated by an LLM-powered [Persona](../02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md). The core unit of work is represented by an `IPersonaInteractionContext` ([Adapter Interfaces](../ClientAdapters/ARCHITECTURE_ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md#2-ipersonainteractioncontext)).

The key goals of this lifecycle are:
*   **Decoupling:** Separate the initial request intake from the potentially longer-running processing and response generation.
*   **Contextualization:** Gather all necessary information (message content, history, files) required to fulfill the user's request accurately.
*   **Ephemeral Processing:** Perform the work within a temporary context, minimizing persistent state related to a single interaction, aligning with [Security Principles](../06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md#3-least-privilege--ephemeral-processing).
*   **Efficiency:** Prepare relevant information concisely for the LLM prompt.

## 2. Trigger and Initiation

The interaction lifecycle begins when a processing component (running within the compute runtime) receives a message *identifier* from its configured asynchronous messaging **subscription** (defined in [Deployment Abstractions](../Deployment/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ABSTRACTIONS.md#2-asynchronous-messaging-pubsub)).

*   **Message Content:** Crucially, the message received typically contains only essential identifiers (e.g., `InteractionId`, `UserId`, source platform message ID, conversation ID) and **not** the potentially sensitive raw message content itself. This aligns with [Security Principles](../06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md#5-data-minimization).
*   **Adapter Identification:** The processing component uses metadata associated with the message or subscription (e.g., topic name, message properties) to determine which specific `IClientAdapter` implementation is responsible for handling this interaction based on its origin platform (e.g., Teams, Console).

## 3. Context Hydration via Adapter

Using the identifiers received in the message, the orchestrator invokes methods on the corresponding `IClientAdapter` instance to "hydrate" the `IPersonaInteractionContext`. This involves retrieving the actual data needed for processing:

*   **Fetch Message Content:** Calling a method like `adapter.GetMessageContentAsync(platformMessageId, context)` to retrieve the user's actual message text.
*   **Retrieve Conversation History:** Calling `adapter.GetConversationHistoryAsync(conversationId, context)` to get recent relevant messages.
*   **Access Artifacts:** If the user message references files or other artifacts (e.g., via URIs in `SourceArtifactUris` from `IMessageContext`), calling methods like `adapter.GetArtifactStreamAsync(artifactUri, context)` to retrieve their content.

The adapter implementation translates these calls into platform-specific API requests (e.g., Microsoft Graph API calls for Teams, local file system access for the Console Adapter). All operations occur within the security context provided by the adapter/platform.

## 4. Ephemeral Markdown Scratchpad

Once the initial context is successfully gathered, the orchestrator creates a temporary markdown file.

*   **Location:** This file resides in the container's ephemeral local storage (e.g., mapped to `/tmp/` or a similar non-persistent directory). Its filename is typically derived from the unique `IPersonaInteractionContext.InteractionId` (e.g., `/tmp/{InteractionId}.md`).
*   **Purpose:** Acts as a short-term "working memory" or scratchpad exclusively for the current interaction. It aggregates the *salient*, *processed* information required for the LLM prompt, structured for clarity.
*   **Content:** Contains concise, structured text snippets relevant to the request. This might include:
    *   Key phrases or summaries from recent conversation history.
    *   Extracted text chunks or summaries from retrieved documents/artifacts.
    *   Relevant results from internal vector searches against the [Knowledge Base](../04_ARCHITECTURE_DATABASE.md).
    *   **Important:** It holds *processed derivatives*, not the raw, potentially large source data.
*   **Lifecycle & Security:**
    *   The scratchpad is strictly ephemeral, intended to exist only for the duration of the interaction processing (typically 5-60 minutes).
    *   It lives in **non-persistent storage**. If the container instance restarts or crashes, the file is lost, which is the desired behavior for security ([Security Principles](../06_ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md#3-least-privilege--ephemeral-processing)).
    *   It **must** be explicitly deleted by the orchestrator upon successful completion or terminal failure of the interaction handling.

## 5. LLM Prompt Assembly & Invocation

The orchestrator constructs the final prompt destined for the AI Service (e.g., Google Gemini, specified in [Hosting Strategies](../Deployment/Hosting/)). This prompt typically includes:

*   The user's direct request (obtained via the adapter).
*   System instructions (defining the Persona's role, capabilities, tone).
*   Relevant context synthesized from the ephemeral markdown scratchpad.

The orchestrator then invokes the AI service API with the assembled prompt.

## 6. Response Delivery & Cleanup

Upon receiving the generated response from the LLM:

1.  **Deliver Response:** The orchestrator calls the appropriate method on the `IClientAdapter` (e.g., `adapter.SendResponseAsync(responseContent, context)`) to deliver the result back to the user on the originating platform.
2.  **Delete Scratchpad:** The orchestrator **explicitly deletes** the temporary markdown file (`/tmp/{InteractionId}.md`) from the ephemeral storage. This cleanup is critical.
3.  **Dispose Context:** The `IPersonaInteractionContext` may be disposed of, releasing any resources held by the adapter or orchestrator related to this specific interaction.

This completes the lifecycle for processing a single user interaction, ensuring context is gathered, processed ephemerally, used for generation, and cleaned up securely. This flow is central to the overall [Processing Architecture](./01_ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING.md).

description: Details the proposed mechanism for routing incoming messages to relevant active Persona sessions and managing session context.

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Orchestration Routing & Salience

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document addresses the complex challenge of routing incoming user messages to potentially multiple relevant, active Persona interaction contexts ("sessions") within the Nucleus system. It details how a message is dequeued, hydrated, assessed for salience against active sessions, and how session context is managed ephemerally.

This builds upon the [Interaction Processing Lifecycle](./ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md) and is a key part of the overall [Processing Orchestration Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_ORCHESTRATION.md).

The primary goals are:
*   **Efficient Hydration:** Fetch message content from the source platform only once.
*   **Accurate Routing:** Deliver the message only to Persona sessions where it is contextually relevant.
*   **Scalability:** Support potentially many concurrent active sessions.
*   **Context Management:** Maintain necessary session state ephemerally.

**The process for determining if a message should initiate a *new* session (if no existing session claims it) and preventing duplicate creation is detailed in [Session Initiation](./ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md).**

## 2. Core Components

*   **`InteractionDispatcher`:** A central orchestration service triggered by messages on its Pub/Sub subscription.
*   **`SessionRegistry`:** 
    *   **Initial Implementation:** An **in-memory collection** (e.g., a thread-safe dictionary managed by a singleton service) within the application instance (e.g., ACA). It tracks active Persona sessions (User + Persona + Conversation) primarily by storing `SessionId` and potentially minimal routing metadata (e.g., ConversationID) and/or identifiers pointing to the location of the session's ephemeral state.
    *   **Future Scaling Options:** Depending on deployment target and scale requirements, if in-memory tracking becomes insufficient, this could potentially leverage platform-specific stateful features (e.g., Cloudflare Durable Objects, Azure Durable Entities) if deployment flexibility allows, while carefully considering the ephemeral processing goals.
    *   **Sensitivity:** The registry holds *identifiers* and routing hints, not the full sensitive session context contained within the scratchpad.
*   **`EphemeralMarkdownScratchpad`:** A temporary file per active session holding its conversation history, current state, draft responses, and metadata.
*   **`InternalEventBus`:** An in-process or distributed mechanism (like MediatR or a lightweight Pub/Sub) for broadcasting events *within* the processing service, primarily used here to fan out the hydrated message to active session handlers.

1.  **Receive & Hydrate:** The `InteractionDispatcher` receives a message identifier from its Pub/Sub subscription and hydrates the content via the appropriate `IClientAdapter`.
2.  **Rule-Based Filtering (Optional):** Apply quick, deterministic filters (e.g., message length, keywords) to potentially discard trivial messages early.
3.  **Broadcast Event:** If not filtered, the dispatcher publishes the hydrated message and metadata via the `InternalEventBus` to all active session handlers.
4.  **Session-Level Salience Check:** Each subscribed active session handler receives the event.
    *   It loads its current context (from its `EphemeralMarkdownScratchpad`).
    *   It performs a salience check: Is this new message relevant to *this specific session's* context?
    *   *Method:* Can range from simple rules to LLM-based comparisons, leveraging the session's rich context.
5.  **Signal Salience & Update (If Salient):**
    *   If a session deems the message salient, it **signals** this back (e.g., publishes a confirmation event, updates a shared marker).
    *   It updates its `EphemeralMarkdownScratchpad`.
    *   It triggers its `IPersona` processing.
6.  **Timeout/Discard (If Not Salient):** If a session determines the message is not salient, it effectively discards the event (potentially after a short processing timeout).
7.  **New Session Decision Point:** The `InteractionDispatcher` (or a coordinating component) waits for a defined period or until all potential sessions have responded/timed out.
    *   If **any** session signaled salience (Step 5), no further action is needed regarding new session creation for this message.
    *   If **no** session signaled salience, the dispatcher proceeds to the logic defined in [Session Initiation](./ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_SESSION_INITIATION.md) to attempt atomic creation of a new session via Cosmos DB.

**Note:** This flow prioritizes letting existing sessions claim relevant messages based on their context, including simple follow-ups, before considering the creation of a new session.

## 4. Ephemeral Markdown Scratchpad Structure

This temporary file acts as the short-term memory for an active session. A possible structure:

```markdown
---
SessionId: unique-session-guid
UserId: user-platform-id
ConversationId: platform-convo-id
PersonaId: persona-name
CurrentProcessingTaskId: task-guid-for-last-message # Tracks ongoing work
LastUpdateTime: timestamp
---

## Interaction Goal/Summary
(Optional: LLM-generated summary of the micro-conversation's objective)

## Conversation History (Recent & Token-Limited)
User (Timestamp): Previous relevant message...
Persona (Timestamp): Previous relevant response...
...

## Current User Message (Timestamp)
(Populated when a message is deemed salient by this session)
The full text of the message being processed.

## Persona Draft / Analysis State
(The Persona reads from and writes to this section during processing)

## Retrieved Knowledge Snippets
(Populated by RAG process during Persona execution)
- Snippet 1 Source: [doc_id]
- Snippet 1 Content: ...
```

## 5. Handling Corrections & Updates

Managing subsequent messages that modify a request already in progress requires careful coordination:

1.  **Task Tracking:** When a Persona begins processing based on the scratchpad, the `CurrentProcessingTaskId` in the scratchpad metadata is set.
2.  **Signal on Update:** If a *new* message (e.g., correction) arrives and is deemed salient by a session handler:
    *   The handler checks the `CurrentProcessingTaskId` in its scratchpad.
    *   If a task is active for the message being corrected, the handler must:
        *   Update the scratchpad content with the correction.
        *   **Signal** the running task (identified by `CurrentProcessingTaskId`) to **abort or restart**. This requires a mechanism like `CancellationToken` or a dedicated signaling channel monitored by the Persona task.
        *   Initiate a *new* processing task using the updated scratchpad.

## 6. LLM Caching Considerations (e.g., Gemini)

While prompt caching can reduce costs for repeated identical inputs, its direct benefit for the *salience check* phase might be limited if checking one new message against many *different* session contexts. The most significant caching benefit is likely during the *main Persona processing step*, where the potentially large and relatively stable content of the `EphemeralMarkdownScratchpad` (especially history) is passed to the LLM.

## 7. Trade-offs

*   **Pros:** Single hydration, decoupled salience logic, aligns with ephemeral principles, event-driven scalability. **Using an initial in-memory `SessionRegistry` significantly reduces infrastructure complexity and dependencies.**
*   **Cons:** Increased application complexity (session management, event bus, scratchpad format), potential cost of per-session salience checks (if using LLMs), complexity in handling updates/corrections robustly. **An in-memory registry's state is lost on instance restart and may require sticky sessions or externalization for certain large-scale, cross-instance coordination scenarios.**

# Nucleus OmniRAG: Orchestration Session Initiation

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-13

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the critical process within the `InteractionDispatcher` for deciding whether an incoming message warrants the creation of a *new* `PersonaInteractionContext` (session). It relies on salience checks performed by *existing* sessions and uses Cosmos DB atomic operations to prevent duplicate session creation when multiple application instances might process the same trigger.

This process follows the initial message hydration and routing described in [Routing & Salience](./ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md) and is part of the overall [Processing Orchestration Overview](../ARCHITECTURE_PROCESSING_ORCHESTRATION.md).

Key Goals:
*   **Accuracy:** Initiate new sessions primarily based on lack of relevance to existing contexts.
*   **Context-Sensitivity:** Allow existing sessions to correctly claim follow-up messages (e.g., simple "yes"/"no" replies) based on their state.
*   **Efficiency:** Avoid unnecessary upfront LLM calls for broad intent classification.
*   **Consistency:** Prevent multiple instances from creating duplicate sessions for the same underlying trigger using database atomicity.

## 2. Filtering and Broadcast for Salience

To avoid unnecessary processing, the `InteractionDispatcher` employs initial filtering and then relies on existing sessions:

1.  **Rule-Based Pre-filtering (Optional):** Apply quick, computationally cheap checks after message hydration:
    *   Is the message extremely short?
    *   Does it match a configurable list of common non-actionable phrases (e.g., "thanks", "ok", "good night")?
    *   Does metadata indicate it's from a bot or system process known to be irrelevant?
    *   If filtered here, the message processing (for *new* session creation) stops. It might still be relevant to *existing* sessions.

2.  **Broadcast for Existing Session Salience:** If not filtered, the hydrated message is broadcast internally via the `InternalEventBus` as described in [Routing & Salience](./ARCHITECTURE_ORCHESTRATION_ROUTING.md). Existing active sessions evaluate the message against their current context (scratchpad) to determine if it's salient to them.
    *   Sessions that deem the message salient will signal this back (mechanism TBD - could be via the event bus or updating a shared marker) and proceed to update their scratchpad and trigger their own processing.

## 3. Decision Point for New Session Creation

The `InteractionDispatcher` instance handling the message proceeds to consider creating a *new* session only if the following condition is met:

1.  **No Existing Session Claim:** After a reasonable timeout following the internal broadcast, *no* existing session has signaled that it claimed the message as salient to its context.

If this condition is true, the dispatcher proceeds to the atomic creation attempt using Cosmos DB.

## 4. Preventing Duplicate Creation (Cosmos DB Conditional Create)

To ensure only one instance successfully creates the new session, even if multiple instances reach the decision point concurrently for the same trigger, a conditional create operation in Cosmos DB is used:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dispatcher Receives & Hydrates Message] --> B{Rule-Based Filtering};
    B -- Filtered --> X(Discard - No Action for New Session);
    B -- Not Filtered --> E[Broadcast Hydrated Message to Active Sessions (Internal Event Bus)];
    E --> F{Salience Check by Active Sessions (Wait/Timeout)};
    subgraph New Session Decision Point
        direction LR
        G{Did *any* existing session claim salience?} --> H{Attempt New Session Creation (via Cosmos DB)};
        G -- Yes --> I(Route to existing salient session(s) - No New Session);
    end
    F --> G; % Connect salience check result to decision point
    H --> J{Derive Unique Placeholder ID (from Message Context)};
    J --> K[Attempt Cosmos DB CreateItemAsync(placeholder ID)];
    K -- Success (201 Created) --> L{Claim Success: Create Scratchpad & Register Session};
    K -- Conflict (409 Conflict) --> M(Claim Failed: Another instance succeeded - Abort);
    L --> N[Trigger Initial Persona Processing];
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Derive Unique Placeholder ID:** Generate a deterministic, unique document ID based on the incoming message context. This ID must be identical across all instances processing the same original message. Examples:
    *   `placeholder:msg:<platform>:<channel_id>:<message_id>`
    *   `placeholder:msg:<platform>:<user_id>:<conversation_id>:<message_timestamp_hash>`

2.  **Attempt Cosmos DB Conditional Create:** Execute `CreateItemAsync` (or equivalent SDK method) in the designated Cosmos DB container (e.g., `SessionPlaceholders` or `ArtifactMetadata`) attempting to create a minimal placeholder document with the derived ID. **Crucially, this operation inherently fails if a document with that ID already exists.**

3.  **Create Succeeded (e.g., HTTP 201):**
    *   This instance has successfully claimed responsibility for the new session.
    *   **Create Session Resources:**
        *   Generate a new unique `SessionId`.
        *   Create the `EphemeralMarkdownScratchpad` file.
        *   Add the new `SessionId` and its metadata/pointers to the in-memory `SessionRegistry`.
    *   **Trigger Initial Processing:** Initiate the first processing step for the new session.
    *   **(Optional):** Update the placeholder document with the actual `SessionId` or processing status.

4.  **Create Failed (e.g., HTTP 409 Conflict):**
    *   Another instance successfully created the placeholder first.
    *   This instance aborts the new session creation process.

## 5. Placeholder Document

The placeholder document itself can be very simple, primarily serving as the lock/existence check:

```json
{
  "id": "placeholder:msg:teams:channel123:messageABC",
  "pk": "placeholder:msg:teams:channel123", // Example partition key
  "messageTimestamp": "2025-04-13T20:55:33Z",
  "status": "claimed", // Could be updated later
  "claimingInstanceId": "aca-instance-xyz",
  "createdSessionId": null, // Could be updated later
  "ttl": 3600 // Optional: Auto-delete after 1 hour
}
```

## 6. Failure Handling

*   **Cosmos DB Availability:** Handle transient errors during the `CreateItemAsync` call with appropriate retry logic.
*   **Resource Creation Failure (Post-Claim):** If scratchpad/registry steps fail *after* successfully creating the placeholder, ideally the placeholder should be deleted or marked as failed to allow another instance to potentially retry (though this adds complexity). Simpler might be to rely on monitoring/alerting for such failures.

# Tutorial:  Part 1 - Set up project and development environment to build a custom knowledge retrieval (RAG) app with the Azure AI Foundry SDK

In this tutorial, you use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) SDK (and other libraries) to build, configure, and evaluate a chat app for your retail company called Contoso Trek. Your retail company specializes in outdoor camping gear and clothing. The chat app should answer questions about your products and services. For example, the chat app can answer questions such as "which tent is the most waterproof?" or "what is the best sleeping bag for cold weather?".

This tutorial is part one of a three-part tutorial.  This part one gets you ready to write code in part two and evaluate your chat app in part three. In this part, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a project
> - Create an Azure AI Search index
> - Install the Azure CLI and sign in
> - Install Python and packages
> - Deploy models into your project
> - Configure your environment variables

If you've completed other tutorials or quickstarts, you might have already created some of the resources needed for this tutorial. If you have, feel free to skip those steps here.

This tutorial is part one of a three-part tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create a project

To create a project in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Home** page of [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Select **+ Create project**.
1. Enter a name for the project.  Keep all the other settings as default.
1. Projects are created in hubs.  If you see **Create a new hub** select it and specify a name.  Then select **Next**. (If you don't see **Create new hub**, don't worry; it's because a new one is being created for you.) 
1. Select **Customize** to specify properties of the hub.
1. Use any values you want, except for **Region**.  We recommend you use either **East US2** or **Sweden Central** for the region for this tutorial series.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Select **Create project**.

## Deploy models

You need two models to build a RAG-based chat app: an Azure OpenAI chat model (`gpt-4o-mini`) and an Azure OpenAI embedding model (`text-embedding-ada-002`). Deploy these models in your Azure AI Foundry project, using this set of steps for each model.

These steps deploy a model to a real-time endpoint from the Azure AI Foundry portal [model catalog](../how-to/model-catalog-overview.md):

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Model catalog**.
1. Select the **gpt-4o-mini** model from the list of models. You can use the search bar to find it. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/select-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the model selection page." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/select-model.png":::

1. On the model details page, select **Deploy**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the model details page with a button to deploy the model." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-model.png":::

1. Leave the default **Deployment name**. select **Deploy**.  Or, if the model isn't available in your region, a different region is selected for you and connected to your project.  In this case, select **Connect and deploy**.

After you deploy the **gpt-4o-mini**, repeat the steps to deploy the **text-embedding-ada-002** model.

## <a name="create-search"></a> Create an Azure AI Search service

The goal with this application is to ground the model responses in your custom data. The search index is used to retrieve relevant documents based on the user's question.

You need an Azure AI Search service and connection in order to create a search index.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating an [Azure AI Search service](/azure/search/) and subsequent search indexes has associated costs. You can see details about pricing and pricing tiers for the Azure AI Search service on the creation page, to confirm cost before creating the resource. For this tutorial, we recommend using a pricing tier of **Basic** or above.

If you already have an Azure AI Search service, you can skip to the [next section](#connect).

Otherwise, you can create an Azure AI Search service using the Azure portal. 

> [!TIP]
> This step is the only time you use the Azure portal in this tutorial series.  The rest of your work is done in Azure AI Foundry portal or in your local development environment.

1. [Create an Azure AI Search service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Search) in the Azure portal.
1. Select your resource group and instance details. You can see details about pricing and pricing tiers on this page.
1. Continue through the wizard and select **Review + assign** to create the resource.
1. Confirm the details of your Azure AI Search service, including estimated cost.
1. Select **Create** to create the Azure AI Search service.

### <a name="connect"></a>Connect the Azure AI Search to your project

If you already have an Azure AI Search connection in your project, you can skip to [Install the Azure CLI and sign in](#installs).

In the Azure AI Foundry portal, check for an Azure AI Search connected resource.

1. In [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), go to your project and select **Management center** from the left pane.
1. In the **Connected resources** section, look to see if you have a connection of type **Azure AI Search**.
1. If you have an Azure AI Search connection, you can skip ahead to the next section.
1. Otherwise, select **New connection** and then **Azure AI Search**.
1. Find your Azure AI Search service in the options and select **Add connection**.
1. Use **API key** for **Authentication**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **API key** option isn't recommended for production. To select and use the recommended **Microsoft Entra ID** authentication option, you must also configure access control for the Azure AI Search service. Assign the *Search Index Data Contributor* and *Search Service Contributor* roles to your user account. For more information, see [Connect to Azure AI Search using roles](../../search/search-security-rbac.md) and [Role-based access control in Azure AI Foundry portal](../concepts/rbac-ai-foundry.md).

1. Select **Add connection**.  


## Create a new Python environment

In the IDE of your choice, create a new folder for your project.  Open a terminal window in that folder.

[!INCLUDE [Install Python](../includes/install-python.md)]

## Install packages

Install `azure-ai-projects`(preview) and `azure-ai-inference` (preview), along with other required packages.

1. First, create a file named **requirements.txt** in your project folder. Add the following packages to the file:

    :::code language="txt" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/requirements.txt":::

1. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Create helper script

Create a folder for your work. Create a file called **config.py** in this folder. This helper script is used in the next two parts of the tutorial series. Add the following code:

:::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/config.py":::

> [!NOTE]
> This script also uses a package you haven't installed yet, `azure.monitor.opentelemetry`.  You'll install this package in the next part of the tutorial series.

## Configure environment variables

[!INCLUDE [create-env-file](../includes/create-env-file-tutorial.md)]

## <a name="installs"></a> Install the Azure CLI and sign in 

[!INCLUDE [Install the Azure CLI](../includes/install-cli.md)]

Keep this terminal window open to run your python scripts from here as well, now that you've signed in.

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, you should delete the resources you created in this tutorial if they're no longer needed. To manage resources, you can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

But don't delete them yet, if you want to build a chat app in [the next part of this tutorial series](copilot-sdk-build-rag.md).

## Next step

In this tutorial, you set up everything you need to build a custom chat app with the Azure AI SDK. In the next part of this tutorial series, you build the custom app.

# Tutorial:  Part 2 - Build a custom knowledge retrieval (RAG) app with the Azure AI Foundry SDK

In this tutorial, you use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) SDK (and other libraries) to build, configure, and evaluate a chat app for your retail company called Contoso Trek. Your retail company specializes in outdoor camping gear and clothing. The chat app should answer questions about your products and services. For example, the chat app can answer questions such as "which tent is the most waterproof?" or "what is the best sleeping bag for cold weather?".

This part two shows you how to enhance a basic chat application by adding [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](../concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation.md) to ground the responses in your custom data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pattern that uses your data with a large language model (LLM) to generate answers specific to your data. In this part two, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Get example data
> - Create a search index of the data for the chat app to use
> - Develop custom RAG code

This tutorial is part two of a three-part tutorial.

## Prerequisites

* Complete [Tutorial:  Part 1 - Create resources for building a custom chat application with the Azure AI SDK](copilot-sdk-create-resources.md) to:

    * Create a project with a connected Azure AI Search index
    * Install the Azure CLI, Python, and required packages
    * Configure your environment variables

## Create example data for your chat app

The goal with this RAG-based application is to ground the model responses in your custom data. You use an Azure AI Search index that stores vectorized data from the embeddings model. The search index is used to retrieve relevant documents based on the user's question.

If you already have a search index with data, you can skip to [Get product documents](#get-documents). Otherwise, you can create a simple example data set to use in your chat app.  

Create an **assets** directory and add this example data to a **products.csv** file:

:::code language="csv" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/assets/products.csv":::

## Create a search index

The search index is used to store vectorized data from the embeddings model. The search index is used to retrieve relevant documents based on the user's question. 

1. Create the file **create_search_index.py** in your main folder (that is, the same directory where you placed your **assets** folder, not inside the **assets** folder).  
1. Copy and paste the following code into your **create_search_index.py** file.
1. Add the code to import the required libraries, create a project client, and configure some settings: 

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/create_search_index.py" id="imports_and_config":::

1. Now add the function to define a search index:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/create_search_index.py" id="create_search_index":::

1. Create the function to add a csv file to the index:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/create_search_index.py" id="add_csv_to_index":::

1. Finally, run the functions to build the index and register it to the cloud project:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/create_search_index.py" id="test_create_index":::

1. From your console, log in to your Azure account and follow instructions for authenticating your account:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1. Run the code to build your index locally and register it to the cloud project:

    ```bash
    python create_search_index.py
    ```

## <a name="get-documents"></a> Get product documents

Next, you create a script to get product documents from the search index. The script queries the search index for documents that match a user's question.

### Create script to get product documents

When the chat gets a request, it searches through your data to find relevant information.  This script uses the Azure AI SDK to query the search index for documents that match a user's question.  It then returns the documents to the chat app.

1. Create the **get_product_documents.py** file in your main directory. Copy and paste the following code into the file.

1. Start with code to import the required libraries, create a project client, and configure settings: 

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/get_product_documents.py" id="imports_and_config":::

1. Add the function to get product documents:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/get_product_documents.py" id="get_product_documents":::

1. Finally, add code to test the function when you run the script directly:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/get_product_documents.py" id="test_get_documents":::

### Create prompt template for intent mapping

The **get_product_documents.py** script uses a prompt template to convert the conversation to a search query. The template instructs how to extract the user's intent from the conversation.  

Before you run the script, create the prompt template. Add the file **intent_mapping.prompty** to your **assets** folder:

:::code language="prompty" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/assets/intent_mapping.prompty":::

### Test the product document retrieval script

Now that you have both the script and template, run the script to test out what documents the search index returns from a query.  In a terminal window run:

```bash
python get_product_documents.py --query "I need a new tent for 4 people, what would you recommend?"
```

## <a name="develop-code"></a> Develop custom knowledge retrieval (RAG) code

Next you create custom code to add retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities to a basic chat application.

### Create a chat script with RAG capabilities

1. In your main folder, create a new file called **chat_with_products.py**. This script retrieves product documents and generates a response to a user's question.
1. Add the code to import the required libraries, create a project client, and configure settings: 

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/chat_with_products.py" id="imports_and_config":::

1. Create the chat function that uses the RAG capabilities:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/chat_with_products.py" id="chat_function":::

1. Finally, add the code to run the chat function:
    
    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/chat_with_products.py" id="test_function":::

### Create a grounded chat prompt template

The **chat_with_products.py** script calls a prompt template to generate a response to the user's question. The template instructs how to generate a response based on the user's question and the retrieved documents.  Create this template now.

In your **assets** folder, add the file **grounded_chat.prompty**:

:::code language="prompty" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/assets/grounded_chat.prompty":::

### Run the chat script with RAG capabilities

Now that you have both the script and the template, run the script to test your chat app with RAG capabilities:

```bash
python chat_with_products.py --query "I need a new tent for 4 people, what would you recommend?"
```

### <a name="logging"></a> Add telemetry logging

To enable logging of telemetry to your project:

1. Add an Application Insights resource to your project.  Navigate to the **Tracing** tab in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/), and create a new resource if you don't already have one.

    :::image type="content" source="../../ai-services/agents/media/ai-foundry-tracing.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the tracing screen in the Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../../ai-services/agents/media/ai-foundry-tracing.png":::

1. Install `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`:

   ```bash
   pip install azure-monitor-opentelemetry
   ```
   
1. Add the `--enable-telemetry` flag when you use the `chat_with_products.py` script:

   ```bash
   python chat_with_products.py --query "I need a new tent for 4 people, what would you recommend?" --enable-telemetry 
   ```

Follow the link in the console output to see the telemetry data in your Application Insights resource. If it doesn't appear right away, wait a few minutes and select **Refresh** in the toolbar.

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, you should delete the resources you created in this tutorial if they're no longer needed. To manage resources, you can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

But don't delete them yet, if you want to deploy your chat app to Azure in [the next part of this tutorial series](copilot-sdk-evaluate.md).

# Tutorial: Part 3 - Evaluate a custom chat application with the Azure AI Foundry SDK

In this tutorial, you use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) SDK (and other libraries) to  evaluate the chat app you built in [Part 2 of the tutorial series](copilot-sdk-build-rag.md). In this part three, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create an evaluation dataset
> - Evaluate the chat app with Azure AI evaluators
> - Iterate and improve your app


This tutorial is part three of a three-part tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- Complete [part 2 of the tutorial series](copilot-sdk-build-rag.md) to build the chat application.
- Make sure you've completed the steps to [add telemetry logging](copilot-sdk-build-rag.md#logging) from part 2.


## <a name="evaluate"></a> Evaluate the quality of the chat app responses

Now that you know your chat app responds well to your queries, including with chat history, it's time to evaluate how it does across a few different metrics and more data.

You use an evaluator with an evaluation dataset and the `get_chat_response()` target function, then assess the evaluation results.

Once you run an evaluation, you can then make improvements to your logic, like improving your system prompt, and observing how the chat app responses change and improve.

### Create evaluation dataset

Use the following evaluation dataset, which contains example questions and expected answers (truth).

1. Create a file called **chat_eval_data.jsonl** in your **assets** folder.
1. Paste this dataset into the file:

    :::code language="jsonl" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/assets/chat_eval_data.jsonl":::

## Evaluate with Azure AI evaluators

Now define an evaluation script that will:

- Generate a target function wrapper around our chat app logic.
- Load the sample `.jsonl` dataset.
- Run the evaluation, which takes the target function, and merges the evaluation dataset with the responses from the chat app.
- Generate a set of GPT-assisted metrics (relevance, groundedness, and coherence) to evaluate the quality of the chat app responses.
- Output the results locally, and logs the results to the cloud project.

The script allows you to review the results locally, by outputting the results in the command line, and to a json file.

The script also logs the evaluation results to the cloud project so that you can compare evaluation runs in the UI.

1. Create a file called **evaluate.py** in your main folder.
1. Add the following code to import the required libraries, create a project client, and configure some settings: 

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/evaluate.py" id="imports_and_config":::

1. Add code to create a wrapper function that implements the evaluation interface for query and response evaluation:

    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/evaluate.py" id="evaluate_wrapper":::

1. Finally, add code to run the evaluation, view the results locally, and gives you a link to the evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal:
 
    :::code language="python" source="~/azureai-samples-main/scenarios/rag/custom-rag-app/evaluate.py" id="run_evaluation":::

### Configure the evaluation model

Since the evaluation script calls the model many times, you might want to increase the number of tokens per minute for the evaluation model.  

In Part 1 of this tutorial series, you created an **.env** file that specifies the name of the evaluation model, `gpt-4o-mini`.  Try to increase the tokens per minute limit for this model, if you have available quota. If you don't have enough quota to increase the value, don't worry.  The script is designed to handle limit errors.

1. In your project in Azure AI Foundry portal, select **Models + endpoints**.
1. Select **gpt-4o-mini**.  
1. Select **Edit**.
1. If you have quota to increase the **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit**, try increasing it to 30 or above. 
1. Select **Save and close**.

### Run the evaluation script

1. From your console, sign in to your Azure account with the Azure CLI:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1. Install the required package:

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-evaluation[remote]
    ```

1. Now run the evaluation script:

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

Expect the evaluation to take a few minutes to complete.

### Interpret the evaluation output

In the console output, you see an answer for each question, followed by a table with summarized metrics. (You might see different columns in your output.)

If you weren't able to increase the tokens per minute limit for your model, you might see some time-out errors, which are expected. The evaluation script is designed to handle these errors and continue running.  

> [!NOTE]
> You may also see many `WARNING:opentelemetry.attributes:` - these can be safely ignored and do not affect the evaluation results.

### View evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal

Once the evaluation run completes, follow the link to view the evaluation results on the **Evaluation** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/develop-rag-copilot-sdk/eval-studio-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows evaluation overview in Azure AI Foundry portal.":::

You can also look at the individual rows and see metric scores per row, and view the full context/documents that were retrieved. These metrics can be helpful in interpreting and debugging evaluation results.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/develop-rag-copilot-sdk/eval-studio-rows.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows rows of evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal.":::

For more information about evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal, see [How to view evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal](../how-to/evaluate-results.md).

## Iterate and improve

Notice that the responses are not well grounded. In many cases, the model replies with a question rather than an answer. This is a result of the prompt template instructions. 
 
* In your **assets/grounded_chat.prompty** file, find the sentence "If the question is not related to outdoor/camping gear and clothing, just say 'Sorry, I only can answer queries related to outdoor/camping gear and clothing. So, how can I help?'"
* Change the sentence to "If the question is related to outdoor/camping gear and clothing but vague, try to answer based on the reference documents, then ask for clarifying questions."  
* Save the file and re-run the evaluation script.

Try other modifications to the prompt template, or try different models, to see how the changes affect the evaluation results.

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, you should delete the resources you created in this tutorial if they're no longer needed. To manage resources, you can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

---

# Tutorial: Deploy an enterprise chat web app

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this article, you deploy an enterprise chat web app that uses your own data with a large language model in Azure AI Foundry portal.

Your data source is used to help ground the model with specific data. Grounding means that the model uses your data to help it understand the context of your question. You're not changing the deployed model itself. Your data is stored separately and securely in your original data source

The steps in this tutorial are:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure resources.
> * Add your data.
> * Test the model with your data.
> * Deploy your web app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- A [deployed Azure OpenAI](../how-to/deploy-models-openai.md) chat model. Complete the [Azure AI Foundry playground quickstart](../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md) to create this resource if you haven't already.

- A Search service connection to index the sample product data.  If you don't have one, follow the steps to [create](copilot-sdk-create-resources.md#create-search) and [connect](copilot-sdk-create-resources.md#connect) a search service.

- A local copy of product data. The [Azure-Samples/rag-data-openai-python-promptflow repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/rag-data-openai-python-promptflow/) contains sample retail product information that's relevant for this tutorial scenario. Specifically, the `product_info_11.md` file contains product information about the TrailWalker hiking shoes that's relevant for this tutorial example. [Download the example Contoso Trek retail product data in a ZIP file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/rag-data-openai-python-promptflow/raw/refs/heads/main/tutorial/data/product-info.zip) to your local machine.

- A **Microsoft.Web** resource provider registered in the selected subscription, to be able to deploy to a web app. For more information on registering a resource provider, see [Register resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1).

- Necessary permissions to add role assignments in your Azure subscription. Granting permissions by role assignment is only allowed by the Owner of the specific Azure resources.

## Azure AI Foundry portal and Azure portal 

In this tutorial, you perform some tasks in the Azure AI Foundry portal and some tasks in the Azure portal.

The Azure AI Foundry portal is a web-based environment for building, training, and deploying AI models. As a developer, it's where you will build and deploy your chat web application.

The Azure portal allows an administrator to manage and monitor Azure resources. As an administrator, you'll use the portal to configure settings for various Azure services required for access from the web app.

## Configure resources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the necessary permissions to add role assignments in your Azure subscription. Granting permissions by role assignment is only allowed by the Owner of the specific Azure resources. You might need to ask your Azure subscription owner (who might be your IT admin) to complete this section for you.

In order for the resources to work correctly inside a web app, you need to configure them with the correct permissions. This work is done in the Azure portal.

To start, identify the resources you need to configure from the Azure AI Foundry portal.

1. Open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) and select the project you used to deploy the Azure OpenAI chat model.
1. Select **Management center** from the left pane.
1. Select **Connected resources** under your project.
1. Identify the three resources you need to configure:  the **Azure OpenAI**, the **Azure AI Search**, and the **Azure Blob storage** that corresponds to your **workspaceblobstore**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app/resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the connected resources that need to be configured.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have multiple **Azure OpenAI** resources, use the one that contains your deployed chat model.

1. For each resource, select the link to open the resource details.  From the details page, select the resource name to open the resource in the Azure portal.  (For the workspaceblobstore, select **View in Azure Portal**). 
1. After the browser tab opens, go back to the Azure AI Foundry portal and repeat the process for the next resource. 
1. When you're done, you should have three new browser tabs open, for **Search service**, **Azure AI services**, and **blobstore Container**. Keep all three new tabs open as you'll go back and forth between them to configure the resources.

### Enable managed identity

On the browser tab for the **Search service** resource in the Azure portal, enable the managed identity:

1. From the left pane, under **Settings**, select **Identity**.
1. Switch **Status** to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.

On the browser tab for the **Azure AI services** resource in the Azure portal, enable the managed identity:

1. From the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Identity**.
1. Switch **Status** to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.

### Set access control for search

On the browser tab for the **Search service** resource in the Azure portal, set the API Access policy:

1. From the left pane, under **Settings**, select **Keys**.
1. Under **API Access control**, select **Both**.
1. When prompted, select **Yes** to confirm the change.

### Assign roles

You'll repeat this pattern multiple times in the bulleted items below.

[!INCLUDE [Assign RBAC](../includes/assign-rbac.md)]

Use these steps to assign roles for the resources you're configuring in this tutorial:

* Assign the following roles on the browser tab for **Search service** in the Azure portal:
    * **Search Index Data Reader** to the **Azure AI services** managed identity
    * **Search Service Contributor** to the **Azure AI services** managed identity
    * **Contributor** to yourself (to find **Contributor**, switch to the **Privileged administrator roles** tab at the top.  All other roles are in the **Job function roles** tab.)

* Assign the following roles on the browser tab for **Azure AI services** in the Azure portal:

    * **Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor** to the **Search service** managed identity
    * **Contributor** to yourself.

* Assign the following roles on the browser tab for **Azure Blob storage** in the Azure portal:

    * **Storage Blob Data Contributor** to the **Azure AI services** managed identity
    * **Storage Blob Data Reader** to the **Search service** managed identity
    * **Contributor** to yourself

You're done configuring resources. You can close the Azure portal browser tabs now if you wish.

## Add your data and try the chat model again

In the [Azure AI Foundry playground quickstart](../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md) (that's a prerequisite for this tutorial), observe how your model responds without your data. Now add your data to the model to help it answer questions about your products.

[!INCLUDE [Chat with your data](../includes/chat-with-data.md)] 

## Deploy your web app

Once you're satisfied with the experience in the Azure AI Foundry portal, you can deploy the model as a standalone web application. 

### Find your resource group in the Azure portal

In this tutorial, your web app is deployed to the same resource group as your [Azure AI Foundry hub](../how-to/create-secure-ai-hub.md). Later you configure authentication for the web app in the Azure portal.

Follow these steps to navigate to your resource group in the Azure portal:

1. Go to your project in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com). Then select **Management center** from the left pane.
1. Under the **Project** heading, select **Overview**.
1. Select the resource group name to open the resource group in the Azure portal. In this example, the resource group is named `rg-sdg-ai`.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/resource-group-manage-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the resource group in the Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/resource-group-manage-page.png":::

1. You should now be in the Azure portal, viewing the contents of the resource group where you deployed the hub. Notice the resource group name and location, you'll use this information in the next section.
1. Keep this page open in a browser tab. You'll return to it later.

### Deploy the web app

Publishing creates an Azure App Service in your subscription. It might incur costs depending on the [pricing plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) you select. When you're done with your app, you can delete it from the Azure portal.

To deploy the web app:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to [register **Microsoft.Web** as a resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1) before you can deploy to a web app. 

1. Complete the steps in the previous section to [add your data](#add-your-data-and-try-the-chat-model-again) to the playground.  (You can deploy a web app with or without your own data, but at least you need a deployed model as described in the [Azure AI Foundry playground quickstart](../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md)).

1. Select **Deploy > ...as a web app**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-web-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the deploy new web app button." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-web-app.png":::

1. On the **Deploy to a web app** page, enter the following details:
    - **Name**: A unique name for your web app.
    - **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription. If you don't see any available subscriptions, first [register **Microsoft.Web** as a resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1).
    - **Resource group**: Select a resource group in which to deploy the web app. Use the same resource group as the hub.
    - **Location**: Select a location in which to deploy the web app. Use the same location as the hub.
    - **Pricing plan**: Choose a pricing plan for the web app.
    - **Enable chat history in the web app**: For the tutorial, the chat history box isn't selected. If you enable the feature, your users have access to their individual previous queries and responses. For more information, see [chat history remarks](#understand-chat-history).

1. Select **Deploy**.

1. Wait for the app to be deployed, which might take a few minutes. 

1. When it's ready, the **Launch** button is enabled on the toolbar. But don't launch the app yet and don't close the chat playground page - you'll return to it later.

### Configure web app authentication

By default, the web app is only accessible to you. In this tutorial, you add authentication to restrict access to the app to members of your Azure tenant. Users are asked to sign in with their Microsoft Entra account to be able to access your app. You can follow a similar process to add another identity provider if you prefer. The app doesn't use the user's sign in information in any other way other than verifying they're a member of your tenant.

1. Return to the browser tab containing the Azure portal (or reopen the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) in a new browser tab) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the web app (you might need to refresh the view the see the web app).

1. Select the **App Service** resource from the list of resources in the resource group.

1. From the collapsible left menu under **Settings**, select **Authentication**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/azure-portal-app-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of web app authentication menu item under settings in the Azure portal." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/azure-portal-app-service.png":::

1. If you see **Microsoft** listed an Identity provider on this page, nothing further is needed.  You can skip the next step.
1. Add an identity provider with the following settings:
    - **Identity provider**: Select Microsoft as the identity provider. The default settings on this page restrict the app to your tenant only, so you don't need to change anything else here.
    - **Tenant type**: Workforce
    - **App registration**: Create a new app registration
    - **Name**: *The name of your web app service*
    - **Supported account types**: Current tenant - Single tenant
    - **Restrict access**: Requires authentication
    - **Unauthenticated requests**: HTTP 302 Found redirect - recommended for websites

### Use the web app

You're almost there. Now you can test the web app.

1. If you changed settings, wait 10 minutes or so for the authentication settings to take effect.
1. Return to the browser tab containing the chat playground page in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. Select **Launch** to launch the deployed web app. If prompted, accept the permissions request.
1. If you don't see **Launch** in the playground, select **Web apps** from the left pane, then select your app from the list to launch it.

    *If the authentication settings haven't yet taken effect, close the browser tab for your web app and return to the chat playground in the Azure AI Foundry portal. Then wait a little longer and try again.*

1. In your web app, you can ask the same question as before ("How much are the TrailWalker hiking shoes"), and this time it uses information from your data to construct the response. You can expand the **reference** button to see the data that was used.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/chat-with-data-web-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the chat experience via the deployed web app." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/chat-with-data-web-app.png":::

## Understand chat history

With the chat history feature, your users have access to their individual previous queries and responses.

You can enable chat history when you [deploy the web app](#deploy-the-web-app). Select the **Enable chat history in the web app** checkbox.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-web-app-chat-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the option to enable chat history when deploying a web app." lightbox="../media/tutorials/chat/deploy-web-app-chat-history.png":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling chat history will create a [Cosmos DB instance](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) in your resource group, and incur [additional charges](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/autoscale-provisioned/) for the storage used.
> Deleting your web app does not delete your Cosmos DB instance automatically. To delete your Cosmos DB instance, along with all stored chats, you need to navigate to the associated resource in the Azure portal and delete it.

Once you enable chat history, your users are able to show and hide it in the top right corner of the app. When the history is shown, they can rename, or delete conversations. As they're logged into the app, conversations are automatically ordered from newest to oldest, and named based on the first query in the conversation.

If you delete the Cosmos DB resource but keep the chat history option enabled on the studio, your users are notified of a connection error, but can continue to use the web app without access to the chat history.

## Update the web app

Use the playground to add more data or test the model with different scenarios. When you're ready to update the web app with the new model, select **Deploy > ...as a web app** again. Select **Update an existing web app** and choose the existing web app from the list. The new model deploys to the existing web app.

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, you should delete the resources you created in this quickstart if they're no longer needed. To manage resources, you can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

# How to use Azure OpenAI Service in Azure AI Foundry portal

You might have existing Azure OpenAI Service resources and model deployments that you created using the old Azure OpenAI Studio or via code. You can pick up where you left off by using your existing resources in Azure AI Foundry portal.

This article describes how to:
- Use Azure OpenAI Service models outside of a project.
- Use Azure OpenAI Service models and an Azure AI Foundry project.

> [!TIP]
> You can use Azure OpenAI Service in Azure AI Foundry portal without creating a project or a connection. When you're working with the models and deployments, we recommend that you work outside of a project. Eventually, you want to work in a project for tasks such as managing connections, permissions, and deploying the models to production.

## Use Azure OpenAI models outside of a project

You can use your existing Azure OpenAI model deployments in Azure AI Foundry portal outside of a project. Start here if you previously deployed models using the old Azure OpenAI Studio or via the Azure OpenAI Service SDKs and APIs.

To use Azure OpenAI Service outside of a project, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Azure AI Foundry home page](https://ai.azure.com) and make sure you're signed in with the Azure subscription that has your Azure OpenAI Service resource.
1. Find the tile that says **Focused on Azure OpenAI Service?** and select **Let's go**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/azure-openai-in-ai-studio/home-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the home page in Azure AI Foundry portal with the option to select Azure OpenAI Service." lightbox="../../media/azure-openai-in-ai-studio/home-page.png":::

    If you don't see this tile, you can also go directly to the [Azure OpenAI Service page](https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview) in Azure AI Foundry portal.

1. You should see your existing Azure OpenAI Service resources. In this example, the Azure OpenAI Service resource `contoso-azure-openai-eastus` is selected.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/ai-services/azure-openai-studio-select-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure OpenAI Service resources page in Azure AI Foundry portal." lightbox="../../media/ai-services/azure-openai-studio-select-resource.png":::

    If your subscription has multiple Azure OpenAI Service resources, you can use the selector or go to **All resources** to see all your resources. 

If you create more Azure OpenAI Service resources later (such as via the Azure portal or APIs), you can also access them from this page.

## <a name="project"></a> Use Azure OpenAI Service in a project

You might eventually want to use a project for tasks such as managing connections, permissions, and deploying models to production. You can use your existing Azure OpenAI Service resources in an Azure AI Foundry project. 

Let's look at two ways to connect Azure OpenAI Service resources to a project:

- [When you create a project](#connect-azure-openai-service-when-you-create-a-project-for-the-first-time)
- [After you create a project](#connect-azure-openai-service-after-you-create-a-project)

### Connect Azure OpenAI Service when you create a project for the first time

When you create a project for the first time, you also create a hub. When you create a hub, you can select an existing Azure AI services resource (including Azure OpenAI) or create a new AI services resource.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/how-to/projects/projects-create-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create resource page within the create project dialog." lightbox="../../media/how-to/projects/projects-create-resource.png":::

For more details about creating a project, see the [create an Azure AI Foundry project](../../how-to/create-projects.md) how-to guide or the [create a project and use the chat playground](../../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md) quickstart.

### Connect Azure OpenAI Service after you create a project

If you already have a project and you want to connect your existing Azure OpenAI Service resources, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Azure AI Foundry project.
1. Select **Management center** from the left pane.
1. Select **Connected resources** (under **Project**) from the left pane. 
1. Select **+ New connection**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/ai-services/connections-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the connected resources page with the button to create a new connection." lightbox="../../media/ai-services/connections-add.png":::

1. On the **Add a connection to external assets** page, select the kind of AI service that you want to connect to the project. For example, you can select Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Content Safety, Azure AI Speech, Azure AI Language, and other AI services.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/ai-services/connections-add-assets.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page to select the kind of AI service that you want to connect to the project." lightbox="../../media/ai-services/connections-add-assets.png":::

1. On the next page in the wizard, browse or search to find the resource you want to connect. Then select **Add connection**.  

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/ai-services/connections-add-azure-openai.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page to select the Azure AI Service resource that you want to connect to the project." lightbox="../../media/ai-services/connections-add-azure-openai.png":::

1. After the resource is connected, select **Close** to return to the **Connected resources** page. You should see the new connection listed.

## Try Azure OpenAI models in the playgrounds

You can try Azure OpenAI models in the Azure OpenAI Service playgrounds outside of a project.

> [!TIP]
> You can also try Azure OpenAI models in the project-level playgrounds. However, while you're only working with the Azure OpenAI Service models, we recommend working outside of a project.

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI Service page](https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview) in Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. Select a playground from under **Resource playground** in the left pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/ai-services/playgrounds/azure-openai-studio-playgrounds.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the playgrounds that you can select to use Azure OpenAI Service." lightbox="../../media/ai-services/playgrounds/azure-openai-studio-playgrounds.png":::

Here are a few guides to help you get started with Azure OpenAI Service playgrounds:
- [Quickstart: Use the chat playground](../../quickstarts/get-started-playground.md)
- [Quickstart: Get started using Azure OpenAI Assistants](../../../ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart.md?context=/azure/ai-studio/context/context)
- [Quickstart: Use GPT-4o in the real-time audio playground](../../../ai-services/openai/realtime-audio-quickstart.md?context=/azure/ai-studio/context/context)
- [Quickstart: Analyze images and video in the chat playground](/azure/ai-services/openai/gpt-v-quickstart)

Each playground has different model requirements and capabilities. The supported regions vary depending on the model. For more information about model availability per region, see the [Azure OpenAI Service models documentation](../../../ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md).

## Fine-tune Azure OpenAI models

In Azure AI Foundry portal, you can fine-tune several Azure OpenAI models. The purpose is typically to improve model performance on specific tasks or to introduce information that wasn't well represented when you originally trained the base model.

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI Service page](https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview) in Azure AI Foundry portal to fine-tune Azure OpenAI models.
1. Select **Fine-tuning** from the left pane.

# Azure Cosmos DB - Database for the AI Era

> "OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service – one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever – enabling high reliability and low maintenance."
> – Satya Nadella, Microsoft chairman and chief executive officer

Today's applications are required to be highly responsive and always online. They must respond in real time to large changes in usage at peak hours, store ever increasing volumes of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds. To achieve low latency and high availability, instances of these applications need to be deployed in datacenters that are close to their users.

The surge of AI-powered applications created another layer of complexity, because many of these applications integrate a multitude of data stores. For example, some organizations built applications that simultaneously connect to MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, and Gremlin. These databases differ in implementation workflow and operational performances, posing extra complexity for scaling applications.

Azure Cosmos DB simplifies and expedites your application development by being the single database for your operational data needs, from [geo-replicated distributed caching](https://medium.com/@marcodesanctis2/using-azure-cosmos-db-as-your-persistent-geo-replicated-distributed-cache-b381ad80f8a0) to backup storage, to [vector indexing and search](vector-database.md). It provides the data infrastructure for modern applications like [AI agent](ai-agents.md), digital commerce, Internet of Things, and booking management. It can accommodate all your operational data models, including relational, document, vector, key-value, graph, and table.

title: Frequently asked questions about Azure Cosmos DB
summary: |
  [!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]
sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the typical use cases for Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          Azure Cosmos DB is well suited for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT use cases. In these use cases; automatic scale, predictable performance, fast order of millisecond response times, and the ability to query over schema-free data is important. Azure Cosmos DB lends itself to rapid development and supporting the continuous iteration of application data models. Applications that manage user-generated content and data often map to [common use cases for Azure Cosmos DB](use-cases.md).
      - question: |
          How does Azure Cosmos DB offer predictable performance?
        answer: |
          A [request unit](request-units.md) (RU) is the measure of throughput in Azure Cosmos DB. A single request unit throughput corresponds to the throughput of the `GET` HTTP action for a 1-kilobite document. Every operation in Azure Cosmos DB; including reads, writes, queries, and stored procedure executions; has a deterministic request unit value based on the throughput required to complete the operation. Instead of being forced to consider CPU, IO, and memory in relation to your application throughput, you can think in terms of request units.

          You can configure each Azure Cosmos DB container with provisioned throughput in terms of request units per second (RU/s). You can benchmark individual requests to measure in request units, and create a container to handle the sum of request units across all requests for that container in a second. You can also scale up or scale down your container's throughput as the needs of your application evolve. For more information on how to measure request units, see the [throughput calculator](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator).
      - question: |
          How does Azure Cosmos DB support various data models such as key/value, columnar, document, and graph?
        answer: |
          Key/value (table), columnar, document, and graph data models are all natively supported because of the ARS (atoms, records, and sequences) design that Azure Cosmos DB is built on. Atoms, records, and sequences can be easily mapped and projected to various data models. The APIs for a subset of models are available using the ARS design (MongoDB RU, NoSQL, Table, Apache Cassandra, and Apache Gremlin). Azure Cosmos DB also supports other APIs such as MongoDB vCore, Cassandra MI, or PostgreSQL. 
      - question: |
          What is an Azure Cosmos DB container?
        answer: |
          A container is a group of items. Containers can span one or more partitions and can scale to handle practically unlimited volumes of storage or throughput.

          | | Containers known as |
          | --- | --- |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** | Container |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB RU** | Collection |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore** | Collection |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra** | Table |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin** | Graph |
          | **Azure Cosmos DB for Table** | Table |
          
          A container is a billable entity, where the throughput and used storage determines the cost. Each container is billed hourly, based on the provisioned throughput and used storage space. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/).
      - question: |
          Can I use multiple APIs to access my data?
        answer: |
          Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service. Multi-model refers to Azure Cosmos DB's support for multiple APIs and data models. In this paradigm, different APIs use different data formats for storage and wire protocol. For example; NoSQL uses JSON, MongoDB uses binary-encoded JSON (BSON), Table uses Entity Data Model (EDM), Cassandra uses Cassandra Query Language (CQL), Gremlin uses JSON format. As a result, we recommend using the same API for all access to the data in a given account.
      - question: |
          Can I integrate Azure Cosmos DB directly with other services?
        answer: |
          Yes. Azure Cosmos DB APIs allow direct integration. For example, the Azure Cosmos DB REST APIs can be integrated with Azure API Management for CRUD operations, eliminating the need for intermediate services like Azure Functions.        
      - question: |
          Is Azure Cosmos DB HIPAA compliant?
        answer: |
          Yes, Azure Cosmos DB is HIPAA-compliant. HIPAA establishes requirements for the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of individually identifiable health information. For more information, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-hipaa-hitech).
      - question: |
          What are the storage limits of Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          There's no limit to the total amount of data that a container can store in Azure Cosmos DB.
      - question: |
          What are the throughput limits of Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          There's no limit to the total amount of throughput that a container can support in Azure Cosmos DB. The key idea is to distribute your workload roughly even among a sufficiently large number of partition keys.
      - question: |
          Are direct and gateway connectivity modes encrypted?
        answer: |
          Yes both modes are always fully encrypted.
      - question: |
          How much does Azure Cosmos DB cost?
        answer: |
          The number of provisioned containers, number of hours containers were online, and the provisioned throughput for each container determines Azure Cosmos DB usage charges. For more pricing details, refer to [Azure Cosmos DB pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/).
      - question: |
          How can I get extra help with Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          To ask a technical question, you can post to one of these two question and answer forums:

  - name: Migrating Azure Cosmos DB Accounts across different resource groups, subscriptions, and tenants
    questions:
    - question: |
        How do I migrate an Azure Cosmos DB account to a different resource group or to a different subscription?
      answer: |
        The general guideline to migrate a Cosmos DB account to a different resource group or subscription is described in the [moving Azure resources to a new resource group or subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) article.

        After successfully moving the Azure Cosmos DB account per the general guideline, any identities (System-Assigned or User-Assigned) associated with the account must be [reassigned](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-managed-identity). This is required in order to ensure that these identities continue to have the necessary permissions to access the Key Vault key.
        > [!WARNING]
        > If your Cosmos DB account has Customer Managed Keys enabled, you can only migrate the account to a different resource group or subscription if it's in an Active state. Accounts in a Revoked state can't be migrated.
    - question: |
        How do I migrate an Azure Cosmos DB account to a different tenant?
      answer: |
        If your Cosmos DB account has Customer Managed Keys enabled, you can only migrate the account if it is a cross-tenant customer-managed key account. For more information, see the guide on [configuring cross-tenant customer-managed keys for your Azure Cosmos DB account with Azure Key Vault](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-cross-tenant-customer-managed-keys?tabs=azure-portal).
        > [!WARNING]
        > After migrating, it's crucial to keep the Azure Cosmos DB account and the Azure Key Vault in separate tenants to preserve the original cross-tenant relationship. Ensure the Key Vault key remains in place until the Cosmos DB account migration is complete.

  - name: Get started with Azure Cosmos DB
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I sign up for Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          Azure Cosmos DB is available in the Azure portal. First, sign up for an Azure subscription. After you sign up, add an Azure Cosmos DB account to your Azure subscription.
      - question: |
          How do I authenticate to Azure Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          A primary key is a security token to access all resources for an account. Individuals with the key have read and write access to all resources in the database account. Multiple keys are available on the **Keys** section of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

          Use caution when you distribute primary keys.
      - question: |
          Where is Azure Cosmos DB available?
        answer: |
          For information about regional availability for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cosmos-db). You can account your database to one or more of these regions.

          The software development kits (SDKs) for Azure Cosmos DB allow configuration of the regions they use for connections. In most SDKs, the `PreferredLocations`` value is set to any of the Azure regions in which Azure Cosmos DB is available.
      - question: |
          Is there anything I should be aware of when distributing data across the world via the Azure datacenters?
        answer: |
          Azure Cosmos DB is present across all Azure regions, as specified on the [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) page. Because it's a core Azure service, every new datacenter has an Azure Cosmos DB presence.

          When you set a region, remember that Azure Cosmos DB respects sovereign and government clouds. For example, you can't replicate data out of a [sovereign region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/). Similarly, you can't enable replication into other sovereign locations from an outside account.
      - question: |
          Is it possible to switch between container-level and database-level throughput provisioning?
        answer: |
          Container and database-level throughput provisioning are separate offerings and switching between either of these require migrating data from source to destination. You need to create a new database or container and then migrate data using [bulk executor library](bulk-executor-overview.md) or [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db).
      - question: |
          Does Azure Cosmos DB support time series analysis?
        answer: |
          Yes, Azure Cosmos DB supports time series analysis. You can use the change feed to build aggregated views over time series data. You can extend this approach by using Apache Spark streaming or another stream data processor.
      - question: |
          What are the Azure Cosmos DB service quotas and throughput limits?
        answer: |
          For information about service quotas and throughput limits, see [service quotas](concepts-limits.md) and [throughout limits](set-throughput.md#comparison-of-models).

# Vector Search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now offers efficient vector indexing and search. This feature is designed to handle multi-modal, high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient and accurate vector search at any scale. You can now store vectors directly in the documents alongside your data. Each document in your database can contain not only traditional schema-free data, but also multi-modal high-dimensional vectors as other properties of the documents. This colocation of data and vectors allows for efficient indexing and searching, as the vectors are stored in the same logical unit as the data they represent. Keeping vectors and data together simplifies data management, AI application architectures, and the efficiency of vector-based operations.

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL offers the flexibility it offers in choosing the vector indexing method: 
- A "flat" or k-nearest neighbors exact search (sometimes called brute-force) can provide 100% retrieval recall for smaller, focused vector searches. especially when combined with query filters and partition-keys.
- A quantized flat index that compresses vectors using DiskANN-based quantization methods for better efficiency in the kNN search.
- DiskANN, a suite of state-of-the-art vector indexing algorithms developed by Microsoft Research to power efficient, high accuracy multi-modal vector search at any scale.

[Learn more about vector indexing here](../index-policy.md#vector-indexes)

Vector search in Azure Cosmos DB can be combined with all other supported Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL query filters and indexes using `WHERE` clauses. This enables your vector searches to be the most relevant data to your applications.

This feature enhances the core capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB, making it more versatile for handling vector data and search requirements in AI applications.

## What is a vector store?

A vector store or [vector database](../vector-database.md) is a database designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, and images, audio, and other types of data can all be vectorized.

## How does a vector store work?

In a vector store, vector search algorithms are used to index and query embeddings. Some well-known vector search algorithms include Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), Inverted File (IVF), DiskANN, etc. Vector search is a method that helps you find similar items based on their data characteristics rather than by exact matches on a property field. This technique is useful in applications such as searching for similar text, finding related images, making recommendations, or even detecting anomalies. It's used to query the [vector embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings) of your data that you created by using a machine learning model by using an embeddings API. Examples of embeddings APIs are [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) or [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/). Vector search measures the distance between the data vectors and your query vector. The data vectors that are closest to your query vector are the ones that are found to be most similar semantically.

In the Integrated Vector Database in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, embeddings can be stored, indexed, and queried alongside the original data. This approach eliminates the extra cost of replicating data in a separate pure vector database. Moreover, this architecture keeps the vector embeddings and original data together, which better facilitates multi-modal data operations, and enables greater data consistency, scale, and performance.

## Enable the vector indexing and search feature

Vector indexing and search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL requires enabling on the Features page of your Azure Cosmos DB. Follow the below steps to register:

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource page.
1. Select the "Features" pane under the "Settings" menu item.
1. Select the “Vector Search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL” feature.
1. Read the description of the feature to confirm you want to enable it.
1. Select "Enable" to turn on the vector indexing and search capability.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, use the Azure CLI to update the capabilities of your account to support NoSQL vector search.
    >
    > ```azurecli
    > az cosmosdb update \
    >      --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    >      --name <account-name> \
    >      --capabilities EnableNoSQLVectorSearch
    > ```
    >

> [!NOTE]  
> The registration request will be autoapproved; however, it may take 15 minutes to fully activate on the account.

## Container Vector Policies

Performing vector search with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL requires you to define a vector policy for the container. This provides essential information for the database engine to conduct efficient similarity search for vectors found in the container's documents. This also informs the vector indexing policy of necessary information, should you choose to specify one. The following information is included in the contained vector policy:

- “path”: the property containing the vector (required).
- “datatype”: the data type of the vector property (default Float32).  
- “dimensions”: The dimensionality or length of each vector in the path. All vectors in a path should have the same number of dimensions. (default 1536).
- “distanceFunction”: The metric used to compute distance/similarity. Supported metrics are:
  - [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), which has values from -1 (least similar) to +1 (most similar).
  - [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product), which has values from -inf (least similar) to +inf (most similar).
  - [euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), which has values from 0 (most similar) to +inf) (least similar).

> [!NOTE]
> Each unique path can have at most one policy. However, multiple policies can be specified provided that they all target a different path.

The container vector policy can be described as JSON objects. Here are two examples of valid container vector policies:

### A policy with a single vector path

```json
{
    "vectorEmbeddings": [
        {
            "path":"/vector1",
            "dataType":"float32",
            "distanceFunction":"cosine",
            "dimensions":1536
        }
    ]
}
```

### A policy with two vector paths

```json
{
    "vectorEmbeddings": [
        {
            "path":"/vector1",
            "dataType":"float32",
            "distanceFunction":"cosine",
            "dimensions":1536
        },
        {
            "path":"/vector2",
            "dataType":"int8",
            "distanceFunction":"dotproduct",
            "dimensions":100
        }
    ]
}
```

## Vector indexing policies

**Vector** indexes increase the efficiency when performing vector searches using the `VectorDistance` system function. Vectors searches have lower latency, higher throughput, and less RU consumption when using a vector index.  You can specify the following types of vector index policies:

| Type | Description | Max dimensions |
| --- | --- |
| **`flat`** | Stores vectors on the same index as other indexed properties. | 505 |
| **`quantizedFlat`** | Quantizes (compresses) vectors before storing on the index. This can improve latency and throughput at the cost of a small amount of accuracy. | 4096 |
| **`diskANN`** | Creates an index based on DiskANN for fast and efficient approximate search. | 4096 |

> [!NOTE]
> The `quantizedFlat` and `diskANN` indexes requires that at least 1,000 vectors to be inserted. This is to ensure accuracy of the quantization process. If there are fewer than 1,000 vectors, a full scan is executed instead and will lead to higher RU charges for a vector search query.

A few points to note:

- The `flat` and `quantizedFlat` index types uses Azure Cosmos DB's index to store and read each vector when performing a vector search. Vector searches with a `flat` index are brute-force searches and produce 100% accuracy or recall. That is, it's guaranteed to find the most similar vectors in the dataset. However, there's a limitation of `505` dimensions for vectors on a flat index.

- The `quantizedFlat` index stores quantized (compressed) vectors on the index. Vector searches with `quantizedFlat` index are also brute-force searches, however their accuracy might be slightly less than 100% since the vectors are quantized before adding to the index. However, vector searches with `quantized flat` should have lower latency, higher throughput, and lower RU cost than vector searches on a `flat` index. This is a good option for smaller scenarios, or scenarios where you're using query filters to narrow down the vector search to a relatively small set of vectors. `quantizedFlat` is recommended when the number of vectors to be indexed is somewhere around 50,000 or fewer per physical partition. However, this is just a general guideline and actual performance should be tested as each scenario can be different.

- The `diskANN` index is a separate index defined specifically for vectors using [DiskANN](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/diskann-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node/), a suite of high performance vector indexing algorithms developed by Microsoft Research. DiskANN indexes can offer some of the lowest latency, highest throughput, and lowest RU cost queries, while still maintaining high accuracy. In general, DiskANN is the most performant of all index types if there are more than 50,000 vectors per physical partition.

Here are examples of valid vector index policies:

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/_etag/?"
        },
        {
            "path": "/vector1/*"
        }
    ],
    "vectorIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/vector1",
            "type": "diskANN"
        }
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/_etag/?"
        },
        {
            "path": "/vector1/*",
        },
        {
            "path": "/vector2/*",
        }
    ],
    "vectorIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/vector1",
            "type": "quantizedFlat"
        },
        {
            "path": "/vector2",
            "type": "diskANN"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The vector path added to the "excludedPaths" section of the indexing policy to ensure optimized performance for insertion. Not adding the vector path to "excludedPaths" will result in higher RU charge and latency for vector insertions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wild card characters (*, []) are not currently supported in the vector policy or vector index.

## Perform vector search with queries using VectorDistance()

Once you created a container with the desired vector policy, and inserted vector data into the container, you can conduct a vector search using the [Vector Distance](query/vectordistance.md) system function in a query. An example of a NoSQL query that projects the similarity score as the alias `SimilarityScore`, and sorts in order of most-similar to least-similar:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 c.title, VectorDistance(c.contentVector, [1,2,3]) AS SimilarityScore   
FROM c  
ORDER BY VectorDistance(c.contentVector, [1,2,3])   
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always use a `TOP N` clause in the `SELECT` statement of a query. Otherwise the vector search will try to return many more results and the query will cost more RUs and have higher latency than necessary.

## Current limitations

Vector indexing and search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL has some limitations. 
- `quantizedFlat` and `diskANN` indexes require at least 1,000 vectors to be indexed to ensure that the quantization is accurate. If fewer than 1,000 vectors are indexed, then a full-scan is used instead and RU charges may be higher. 
- Vectors indexed with the `flat` index type can be at most 505 dimensions. Vectors indexed with the `quantizedFlat` or `DiskANN` index type can be at most 4,096 dimensions.
- The rate of vector insertions should be limited. Very large ingestion (in excess of 5M vectors) may require additional index build time. 
- The vector search feature is not currently supported on the existing containers. To use it, a new container must be created, and the container-level vector embedding policy must be specified.
- Shared throughput databases are unsupported.
- At this time, vector indexing and search is not supported on accounts with Analytical Store (and Synapse Link) and Shared Throughput.
- Once vector indexing and search is enabled on a container, it cannot be disabled.

# Full-text search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL (preview)

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now offers a powerful Full Text Search feature in preview, designed to enhance the search capabilities of your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account
- [Vector search](vector-search-overview.md) feature enabled

## What is full text search?

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now offers a powerful Full Text Search feature in preview, designed to enhance your data querying capabilities. This feature includes advanced text processing techniques such as stemming, stop word removal, and tokenization, enabling efficient and effective text searches through a specialized text index. Full text search also includes *full text scoring* with a function that evaluates the relevance of documents to a given search query. BM25, or Best Matching 25, considers factors like term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length to score and rank documents. This helps ensure that the most relevant documents appear at the top of the search results, improving the accuracy and usefulness of text searches.

Full Text Search is ideal for a variety of scenarios, including:

- **E-commerce**: Quickly find products based on descriptions, reviews, and other text attributes.
- **Content management**: Efficiently search through articles, blogs, and documents.
- **Customer support**: Retrieve relevant support tickets, FAQs, and knowledge base articles.
- **User content**: Analyze and search through user-generated content such as posts and comments.
- **RAG for chatbots**: Enhance chatbot responses by retrieving relevant information from large text corpora, improving the accuracy and relevance of answers.
- **Multi-Agent AI apps**: Enable multiple AI agents to collaboratively search and analyze vast amounts of text data, providing comprehensive and nuanced insights.

## How to use full text search

1. Enable the "Full Text & Hybrid Search for NoSQL" preview feature.
2. Configure a container with a full text policy and full text index.
3. Insert your data with text properties.
4. Run hybrid queries against the data.

## Enable the full text and hybrid search for NoSQL preview feature

Full text search, full text scoring, and hybrid search all require enabling the preview feature on your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account before using. Follow the below steps to register:

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource page.
2. Select the "Features" pane under the "Settings" menu item.
3. Select the "Full-Text & Hybrid Search for NoSQL API (preview)" feature.
4. Read the description of the feature to confirm you want to enable it.
5. Select "Enable" to turn on the vector indexing and search capability.

:::image type="content" source="../nosql/media/full-text-search/full-text-search-feature.png" alt-text="Screenshot of full text and hybrid search preview feature in the Azure portal.":::

### Configure container policies and indexes for hybrid search

To use full text search capabilities, you'll first need to define two policies:
- A container-level full text policy that defines what paths will contain text for the new full text query system functions.
- A full text index added to the indexing policy that enables efficient search.

### Full text policy

For every text property you'd like to configure for full text search, you must declare both the `path` of the property with text and the `language` of the text. A simple full text policy can be:

 ```json
{
    "defaultLanguage": "en-US",
    "fullTextPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/text",
            "language": "en-US"
        }
    ]
}
```

Defining multiple text paths is easily done by adding another element to the `fullTextPolicy` array:

 ```json
{
    "defaultLanguage": "en-US",
    "fullTextPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/text1",
            "language": "en-US"
        },
        {
            "path": "/text2",
            "language": "en-US"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> English ("en-us" as the language) is the only supported language at this time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wild card characters (*, []) are not currently supported in the full text policy or full text index.

### Full text index

Any full text search operations should make use of a [*full text index*](../index-policy.md#full-text-indexes). A full text index can easily be defined in any Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL index policy per the example below.

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        },
    ],
    "fullTextIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/text"
        }
    ]
}
```

Just as with the full text policies, full text indexes can be defined on multiple paths.

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        },
    ],
    "fullTextIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/text"
        },
        {
            "path": "/text2"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Full text search queries

Full text search and scoring operations are performed using the following system functions in the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL query language:

- [`FullTextContains`](../nosql/query/fulltextcontains.md): Returns `true` if a given string is contained in the specified property of a document. This is useful in a `WHERE` clause when you want to ensure specific key words are included in the documents returned by your query.
- [`FullTextContainsAll`](../nosql/query/fulltextcontainsall.md): Returns `true` if *all* of the given strings are contained in the specified property of a document. This is useful in a `WHERE` clause when you want to ensure that multiple key words are included in the documents returned by your query.
- [`FullTextContainsAny`](../nosql/query/fulltextcontainsany.md): Returns `true` if *any* of the given strings are contained in the specified property of a document. This is useful in a `WHERE` clause when you want to ensure that at least one of the key words is included in the documents returned by your query.
- [`FullTextScore`](../nosql/query/fulltextscore.md): Returns a score. This can only be used in an `ORDER BY RANK` clause, where the returned documents are ordered by the rank of the full text score, with most relevant (highest scoring) documents at the top, and least relevant (lowest scoring) documents at the bottom.

Here are a few examples of each function in use.

#### FullTextContains

In this example, we want to obtain the first 10 results where the keyword "bicycle" is contained in the property `c.text`.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM c
WHERE FullTextContains(c.text, "bicycle")
```

#### FullTextContainsAll

In this example, we want to obtain first 10 results where the keywords "red" and "bicycle" are contained in the property `c.text`.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM c
WHERE FullTextContainsAll(c.text, "red", "bicycle")
```

#### FullTextContainsAny

In this example, we want to obtain the first 10 results where the keywords "red" and either "bicycle" or "skateboard"  are contained in the property `c.text`.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM c
WHERE FullTextContains(c.text, "red") AND FullTextContainsAny(c.text, "bicycle", "skateboard")
```

#### FullTextScore

In this example, we want to obtain the first 10 results where "mountain" and "bicycle" are included, and sorted by order of relevance. That is, documents that have these terms more often should appear higher in the list. 

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM c
ORDER BY RANK FullTextScore(c.text, ["bicycle", "mountain"])
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FullTextScore can only be used in the `ORDER BY RANK` clause and not projected in the `SELECT` statement or in a `WHERE` clause.

# Hybrid search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL (preview)

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now supports a powerful hybrid search capability that combines Vector Search with Full Text Search scoring (BM25) using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) function.

## What is hybrid search?

Hybrid search leverages the strengths of both vector-based and traditional keyword-based search methods to deliver more relevant and accurate search results. Hybrid search is easy to do in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL due to the ability to store both metadata and vectors within the same document.

Hybrid search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL integrates two distinct search methodologies:

- **Vector search**: Utilizes machine learning models to understand the semantic meaning of queries and documents. This allows for more nuanced and context-aware search results, especially useful for complex queries where traditional keyword search might fall short.
- **Full text search (BM25)**: A well-established algorithm that scores documents based on the presence and frequency of words and terms. BM25 is particularly effective for straightforward keyword searches, providing a robust baseline for search relevance.

The results from vector search and full text search are then combined using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) function. RRF is a rank aggregation method that merges the rankings from multiple search algorithms to produce a single, unified ranking. This ensures that the final search results benefit from the strengths of both search approaches and offers multiple benefits.

- **Enhanced Relevance**: By combining semantic understanding with keyword matching, hybrid search delivers more relevant results for a wide range of queries.
- **Improved Accuracy**: The RRF function ensures that the most pertinent results from both search methods are prioritized.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for various use cases including [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](rag.md) to improve the responses generated by an LLM grounded on your own data.

## How to use hybrid search

1. Enable the [Vector Search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL feature](../nosql/vector-search.md#enable-the-vector-indexing-and-search-feature).
1. Enable the [Full Text & Hybrid Search for NoSQL preview feature](../gen-ai/full-text-search.md#enable-the-full-text-and-hybrid-search-for-nosql-preview-feature).
1. Create a container with a vector policy, full text policy, vector index, and full text index.
1. Insert your data with text and vector properties.
1. Run hybrid queries against the data.

## Configure policies and indexes for hybrid search

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, vector policies and vector indexes are immutable after creation. To make changes, please create a new collection.

### A sample vector policy

 ```json
{
    "vectorEmbeddings": [
        {
            "path":"/vector",
            "dataType":"float32",
            "distanceFunction":"cosine",
            "dimensions":3
        },

}
```

### A sample full text policy

```json
{
    "defaultLanguage": "en-US",
    "fullTextPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/text",
            "language": "en-US"
        }
    ]
}
```

### A sample indexing policy with both full text and vector indexes

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        },
        {
            "path": "/vector/*"
        }
    ],
    "fullTextIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/text"
        }
    ],
    "vectorIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/vector",
            "type": "DiskANN"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Hybrid search queries

Hybrid search queries can be executed by leveraging the [`RRF`](../nosql/query/rrf.md) system function in an `ORDER BY RANK` clause that includes both a `VectorDistance` function and `FullTextScore`. For example, a parameterized query to find the top *k* most relevant results would look like:

```sql
SELECT TOP @k *
FROM c
ORDER BY RANK RRF(VectorDistance(c.vector, @queryVector), FullTextScore(c.content, [@searchTerm1, @searchTerm2, ...]))
```

Suppose you have a document that has vector embeddings stored in each document in the property `c.vector` and text data contained in the property c.text. To get the 10 most relevant documents using Hybrid search, the query can be written as:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 * 
FROM c
ORDER BY RANK RRF(VectorDistance(c.vector, [1,2,3]), FullTextScore(c.text, ["text", "to", "search", "goes" ,"here])
```

# Vector search in Azure Cosmos DB

Vector search is a method that helps you find similar items based on their data characteristics rather than by exact matches on a property field. This technique is useful in applications such as searching for similar text, finding related images, making recommendations, or even detecting anomalies. It works by taking the [vector embeddings](vector-embeddings.md) of your data and query, and then measuring the [distance](distance-functions.md) between the data vectors and your query vector. The data vectors that are closest to your query vector are the ones that are found to be most similar semantically.

## Examples

This [interactive visualization](https://openai.com/index/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings/#_1Vr7cWWEATucFxVXbW465e) shows some examples of closeness and distance between vectors.

## Algorithms

Two major types of vector search algorithms are k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN). Between [kNN and ANN](knn-vs-ann.md), the latter offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it better suited for large-scale applications. Some well-known ANN algorithms include Inverted File (IVF), Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), and the state-of-the-art DiskANN.

Using an integrated vector search feature in a fully featured database ([as opposed to a pure vector database](../vector-database.md#integrated-vector-database-vs-pure-vector-database)) offers an efficient way to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector data directly alongside other application data. This approach removes the necessity of migrating your data to costlier alternative vector databases and provides a seamless integration of your AI-driven applications.

# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Azure Cosmos DB

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with robust information retrieval systems to create more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Unlike traditional generative models that rely solely on pre-trained data, RAG architectures enhance an LLM's capabilities by integrating real-time information retrieval. This augmentation ensures responses are not only generative but also grounded in the most relevant, up-to-date data available.

Azure Cosmos DB, an operational database that supports vector search, stands out as an excellent platform for implementing RAG. Its ability to handle both operational and analytical workloads in a single database, along with advanced features such as multitenancy and hierarchical partition keys, provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated generative AI applications.

## Key Advantages of Using Azure Cosmos DB

### Unified data storage and retrieval

Azure Cosmos DB enables seamless integration of [vector search](../nosql/vector-search.md) capabilities within a unified database system. This means that your operational data and vectorized data coexist, eliminating the need for separate indexing systems. 

### Real-Time data ingestion and querying

Azure Cosmos DB supports real-time ingestion and querying, making it ideal for AI applications. This is crucial for RAG architectures, where the freshness of data can significantly impact the relevance of generated responses.

### Scalability and global distribution

Designed for large-scale applications, Azure Cosmos DB offers global distribution and [instant autoscale](../../cosmos-db/provision-throughput-autoscale.md). This ensures that your RAG-enabled application can handle high query volumes and deliver consistent performance irrespective of user location.

### High availability and reliability

Azure Cosmos DB offers comprehensive SLAs for throughput, latency, and [availability](/azure/reliability/reliability-cosmos-db-nosql). This reliability ensures that your RAG system is always available to generate responses with minimal downtime.

### Multitenancy with hierarchical partition keys

Azure Cosmos DB supports [multitenancy](../nosql/multi-tenancy-vector-search.md) through various performance and security isolation models, making it easier to manage data for different clients or user groups within the same database. This feature is particularly useful for SaaS applications where separation of tenant data is crucial for security and compliance.

### Comprehensive security features

With built-in features such as end-to-end encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and virtual network (VNet) integration, Azure Cosmos DB ensures that your data remains secure. These security measures are essential for enterprise-grade RAG applications that handle sensitive information.

## Implementing RAG with Azure Cosmos DB

> [!TIP]
> For RAG samples, visit: [AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples)

Here's a streamlined process for building a RAG application with Azure Cosmos DB:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Store your documents, images, and other content types in Azure Cosmos DB. Utilize the database's support for vector search to index and retrieve vectorized content.
1. **Query Execution**: When a user submits a query, Azure Cosmos DB can quickly retrieve the most relevant data using its vector search capabilities.
1. **LLM Integration**: Pass the retrieved data to an LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI) to generate a response. The well-structured data provided by Cosmos DB enhances the quality of the model's output.
1. **Response Generation**: The LLM processes the data and generates a comprehensive response, which is then delivered to the user.

# Introduction to semantic cache

Large language models (LLM) are amazing with their ability to generate completions, or text responses, based upon user prompts. As with any service, they have a compute cost to them. For an LLM, this is typically expressed in [tokens](tokens.md).

A semantic cache provides a way for you to use prior user prompts and LLM completions to address similar user prompts using vector similarity search. A semantic cache can reduce latency and save costs in your GenAI applications as making calls to LLMs is often the most costly and highest latency service in such applications.

In a scenario where an LLM processes a simple prompt, this computational cost is low. However, LLMs don't retain any context between prompts and completions. It's necessary to send some portion of the chat history to the LLM when sending the latest prompt to be processed to give it context. This mechanism is often referred to as a *context window* and is a sliding window of prompts and completions, between a user and an LLM. This extra text increases the compute cost, or tokens, required to process the request. Additionally, as the amount of text increases, so too does the latency for the generating the completion.

In pattern called Retrieval Augmented Generation or [RAG Pattern](rag.md) for short, data from an external source such as a database, is sent with the user prompt and context window to *augment* or ground the LLM. The data from external sources provides extra information to generate a completion. The size of the payloads for RAG Pattern to an LLM can often get rather large. It's not uncommon to consume thousands of tokens and wait for many seconds to generate a completion. In a world where milliseconds counts, waiting for many seconds is often an unacceptable user experience. The cost can also get expensive at high volumes.

The solution typically used to deal with requests with high computational costs and latency is to employ a cache. This scenario isn't different, however, there are differences in how a semantic cache works, and how it's implemented.

## How a semantic cache works

A traditional cache that uses a string equality match for perform a cache lookup on the cache keys A semantic cache uses a *vector query* on the cache keys, which are stored as vectors. To perform a vector search query for the cache lookup, text is converted into a vector embedding and then used to find vectors that are most *similar* in the cache's keys.

The use of a vector query versus key value look up has some advantages. A traditional cache typically returns just a single result for a cache hit. Because a semantic cache uses a query, it can optionally return multiple results to the user. Providing more items to choose from can help reduce compute costs further. It can potentially keep the cache size smaller by reducing the number of items, which need to get generated by the LLM due to cache misses.

## Similarity score

All vector queries return what is referred to as a *similarity score* that represents how close the vectors are to each other in high dimensional space. Values range from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (exact match).

In a vector query, the similarity score for the returned results represents how similar the words or users intent are to what was passed in the WHERE clause. Because a query can return multiple results, the results can be sorted from the most likely to least likely cache results for a user to choose from.

The similarity score is used as a filter for a vector query to limit the results returned to those items most likely to match the users' intent. In practice, setting the similarity score value for a vector query may require some trial and error. Too high, and the cache quickly fills up with multiple responses for similar questions because of repeated cache misses. Too low, and the cache returns too many irrelevant responses that don't match the user's intent.

## Context window

Large language models don't maintain context between requests. To have a *conversation* with an LLM, you have to maintain a context window, or chat history and pass that to the LLM for each request so it can provide a contextually relevant response. 

For a semantic cache to be effective, it needs to have that context as well. In other words, a semantic cache shouldn't just use the text from individual prompts as keys, it should use some portion of the prompts in the chat history as well. Doing so ensures that what gets returned from the cache is also contextually correct, just as it would be if it were generated by an LLM. If a cache didn't have the context from the chat history, users would get unexpected, and likely unacceptable responses.

Here's a simple mental exercise to explain why this is. If you first ask an LLM, "What is the largest lake in North America?", it responds with "Lake Superior" with some facts and figures, then cache the vectorized user prompt and text from the completion.

If you then ask, "What is the second largest?", the LLM is passed the context window of the previous prompt and completion with the follow-up question and correctly responds, "Lake Huron". Then cache the second prompt, "What is the second largest?" and the generated completion, "Lake Huron".

Later, another user in a different session asks, "What is the largest stadium in North America?", the LLM responds with, "Michigan Stadium" with some facts and figures. If that user then asks, "What is the second largest?", the cache finds an exact match for that prompt and return, "Lake Huron", which is incorrect.

For this reason, a semantic cache should operate within a context window. The context window already provides the information necessary for an LLM to generate relevant completions. This makes it a logical choice for how the cache should work as well. 

Implementing this requires first vectorizing the array of prompts from the context window and the last prompt. The vectors are first then used in the WHERE clause in the vector query on the cache key. What is returned is the completion from the same sequence of questions asked previously by another user. As the context window continuously slides forward in the conversation, any sequence of prompts that have high similarity are returned by the cache versus being regenerated by the LLM.

## Maintenance

As with any cache there's the potential for it to grow to enormous size. Keeping a semantic cache requires the same kind of maintenance. There are multiple ways to maintain its size including using a time-to-live (TTL) for cached items, limit the maximum size, or limit the number of items in the cache.

The use of a similarity score also provides a mechanism for keeping the cache lean. The lower the similarity score in the WHERE clause for the vector query on a cache can increase the number of cache hits, reducing the need to generate and cache completions for similar user prompts. However this comes at a cost of potentially returning less relevant results.

Other possible techniques that use a TTL but also preserve frequent cache hits could include keeping a cache hit score on items and implement a mechanism to prune the cache that are based upon cache hit score. This could be implemented using a patch operation to increment a hit-count property on a cache item. Then override the TTL on that item to preserve it in the cache if it reaches some pre-determined threshold of cache hits.

There may also be other considerations in how to maintain a cache beyond just efficiency. It's widely understood users' chat history can allow developers to tune applications that use an LLM to generate completions. Chat history also provides valuable data on users' interactions with these types of applications and can yield significant insights on their sentiment and behaviors. The same is true for cache usage as well.

It may be desirable to keep the entire contents of a cache and use it for further analysis, yet ensure that users only see the most recent cached entries. In scenarios like this, a possible technique may use an extra filter in the WHERE clause for the vector query on the cache that filters for the most recent cached items or sorts them based upon freshness. For example, `WHERE c.lastUpdated > @someDate ORDER BY c.lastUpdated DESC`

# Multitenancy for vector search in Azure Cosmos DB

> "OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service – one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever – enabling high reliability and low maintenance."
> — Satya Nadella

Azure Cosmos DB stands out as the world's first full-featured serverless operational database with vector search, offering unparalleled scalability and performance. By using Azure Cosmos DB, users can enhance their vector search capabilities, ensuring high reliability and low maintenance for multitenant applications.

Multitenancy enables a single instance of a database to serve multiple customers, or tenants, simultaneously. This approach efficiently shares infrastructure and operational overhead, resulting in cost savings and simplified management. It's a crucial design consideration for SaaS applications and some internal enterprise solutions.

Multitenancy introduces complexity. Your system must scale efficiently to maintain high performance across all tenants, who may have unique workloads, requirements, and service-level agreements (SLAs).

Imagine a fictional AI-assisted research platform called ResearchHub. Serving thousands of companies and individual researchers, ResearchHub manages varying user bases, data scales, and SLAs. Ensuring low query latency and high performance is vital for sustaining an excellent user experience.

Azure Cosmos DB, with its [DiskANN vector index](../index-policy.md#vector-indexes) capability, simplifies multitenant design, providing efficient data storage and access mechanisms for high-performance applications.

## Multi-tenancy models in Azure Cosmos DB

In Azure Cosmos DB, we recommend two primary approaches to managing multi-tenancy: partition key-per-tenant or account-per-tenant, each with its own set of benefits and trade-offs.

### 1. Partition key-per-tenant

For a higher density of tenants and lower isolation, the partition key-per-tenant model is effective. Each tenant is assigned a unique partition key within a given container, allowing logical separation of data. This strategy works best when each tenant has roughly the same workload volume. If there is significant skew, customers should consider isolating those tenants in their own account. Additionally, if a single tenant has more than 20GB of data, [hierarchical partition keys (HPK)](#hierarchical-partitioning-enhanced-data-organization) should be used. For vector search in particular, quantizedFlat index may perform very well if vector search queries can be focused to a particular partition or sets of partitions.

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Efficiency:** Sharing a single Cosmos DB account across multiple tenants reduces overhead.
- **Scalability:** Can manage a large number of tenants, each isolated within their partition key.
- **Simplified Management:** Fewer Cosmos DB accounts to manage.
- **Hierarchical Partition Keys (HPK):** Optimizes data organization and query performance in multitenant apps with a high number of tenants.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Resource Contention:** Shared resources can lead to contention during peak usage.
- **Limited Isolation:** Logical but not physical isolation, which may not meet strict isolation requirements.
- **Less Flexibility:** Reduced flexibility per tenant for enabling account-level features like geo-replication, point-in-time restore (PITR), and customer-managed keys (CMK).

### Hierarchical partitioning: enhanced data organization

[Hierarchical partitioning](../hierarchical-partition-keys.md) builds on the partition key-per-tenant model, adding deeper levels of data organization. This method involves creating multiple levels of partition keys for more granular data management. The lowest level of  hierarchical partitioning should have high cardinality. Typically, it is recommended to use an ID/guid for this level to ensure continuous scalability beyond 20GB per tenant.

**Advantages:**
- **Optimized Queries:** More precise targeting of subpartitions at the parent partition level reduces query latency.
- **Improved Scalability:** Facilitates deeper data segmentation for easier scaling.
- **Better Resource Allocation:** Evenly distributes workloads, minimizing bottlenecks for high tenant counts.

**Considerations:**
- If applications have very few tenants and use hierarchical partitioning, this can lead to bottlenecks since all documents with the same first-level key will write to the same physical partition(s).

**Example:**
ResearchHub can stratify data within each tenant’s partition by organizing it at various levels such as "DepartmentId" and "ResearcherId," facilitating efficient management and queries.

![ResearchHub AI Data Stratification](../media/gen-ai/multi-tenant/hpk.png)

### 2. Account-per-tenant

For maximum isolation, the account-per-tenant model is preferable. Each tenant gets a dedicated Cosmos DB account, ensuring complete separation of resources.

**Benefits:**
- **High Isolation:** No contention or interference due to dedicated resources.
- **Custom SLAs:** Resources and SLAs can be tailored to individual tenant needs.
- **Enhanced Security:** Physical data isolation ensures robust security.
- **Flexibility:** Tenants can enable account-level features like geo-replication, point-in-time restore (PITR), and customer-managed keys (CMK) as needed.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Increased Management:** Higher complexity in managing multiple Cosmos DB accounts.
- **Higher Costs:** More accounts mean higher infrastructure costs.

## Security isolation with customer-managed keys

Azure Cosmos DB enables [customer-managed keys](../how-to-setup-customer-managed-keys.md) for data encryption, adding an extra layer of security for multitenant environments.

**Steps to Implement:**
- **Set Up Azure Key Vault:** Securely store your encryption keys.
- **Link to Cosmos DB:** Associate your Key Vault with your Cosmos DB account.
- **Rotate Keys Regularly:** Enhance security by routinely updating your keys.

Using customer-managed keys ensures each tenant's data is encrypted uniquely, providing robust security and compliance.

![ResearchHub AI Account-per-tenant](../media/gen-ai/multi-tenant/account.png)

## Other isolation models

### Container and database isolation

In addition to the partition key-per-tenant and account-per-tenant models, Azure Cosmos DB provides other isolation methods such as container isolation and database isolation. These approaches offer varying degrees of performance isolation, though they don't provide the same level of security isolation as the account-per-tenant model.

#### Container isolation

In the container isolation model, each tenant is assigned a separate container within a shared Cosmos DB account. This model allows for some level of isolation in terms of performance and resource allocation.

**Benefits:**
- **Better Performance Isolation:** Containers can be allocated specific performance resources, minimizing the impact of one tenant’s workload on another.
- **Easier Management:** Managing multiple containers within a single account is generally easier than managing multiple accounts.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Similar to the partition key-per-tenant model, this method reduces the overhead of multiple accounts.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Limited Security Isolation:** Unlike separate accounts, containers within the same account don't provide physical data isolation. So, this model may not meet stringent security requirements.
- **Resource Contention:** Heavy workloads in one container can still affect others if resource limits are breached.

#### Database isolation

The database isolation model assigns each tenant a separate database within a shared Cosmos DB account. This provides enhanced isolation in terms of resource allocation and management.

**Benefits:**
- **Enhanced Performance:** Separate databases reduce the risk of resource contention, offering better performance isolation.
- **Flexible Resource Allocation:** Resources can be allocated and managed at the database level, providing tailored performance capabilities.
- **Centralized Management:** Easier to manage compared to multiple accounts, yet offering more isolation than container-level separation.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Limited Security Isolation:** Similar to container isolation, having separate databases within a single account does not provide physical data isolation.
- **Complexity:** Managing multiple databases can be more complex than managing containers, especially as the number of tenants grows.

While container and database isolation models don't offer the same level of security isolation as the account-per-tenant model, they can still be useful for achieving performance isolation and flexible resource management. These methods are beneficial for scenarios where cost efficiency and simplified management are priorities, and stringent security isolation is not a critical requirement.

By carefully evaluating the specific needs and constraints of your multitenant application, you can choose the most suitable isolation model in Azure Cosmos DB, balancing performance, security, and cost considerations to achieve the best results for your tenants.

## Real-world implementation considerations

When designing a multitenant system with Cosmos DB, consider these factors:

- **Tenant Workload:** Evaluate data size and activity to select the appropriate isolation model.
- **Performance Requirements:** Align your architecture with defined SLAs and performance metrics.
- **Cost Management:** Balance infrastructure costs against the need for isolation and performance.
- **Scalability:** Plan for growth by choosing scalable models.

### Practical implementation in Azure Cosmos DB

**Partition Key-Per-Tenant:**
- **Assign Partition Keys:** Unique keys for each tenant ensure logical separation.
- **Store Data:** Tenant data is confined to respective partition keys.
- **Optimize Queries:** Use partition keys for efficient, targeted queries.

**Hierarchical Partitioning:**
- **Create Multi-Level Keys:** Further organize data within tenant partitions.
- **Targeted Queries:** Enhance performance with precise sub-partition targeting.
- **Manage Resources:** Distribute workloads evenly to prevent bottlenecks.

**Account-Per-Tenant:**
- **Provide Separate Accounts:** Each tenant gets a dedicated Cosmos DB account.
- **Customize Resources:** Tailor performance and SLAs to tenant requirements.
- **Ensure Security:** Physical data isolation offers robust security and compliance.

## Best practices for using Azure Cosmos DB with vector search

Azure Cosmos DB's support for DiskANN vector index capability makes it an excellent choice for applications that require fast, high-dimensional searches, such as AI-assisted research platforms like ResearchHub. Here’s how you can leverage these capabilities:

**Efficient Storage and Retrieval:**
- **Vector Indexing:** Use the DiskANN vector index to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors. This is useful for applications that involve similarity searches in large datasets, such as image recognition or document similarity.
- **Performance Optimization:** DiskANN’s vector search capabilities enable quick, accurate searches, ensuring low latency and high performance, which is critical for maintaining a good user experience.

**Scaling Across Tenants:**
- **Partition Key-Per-Tenant:** Utilize partition keys to logically isolate tenant data while benefiting from Cosmos DB’s scalable infrastructure.
- **Hierarchical Partitioning:** Implement hierarchical partitioning to further segment data within each tenant’s partition, improving query performance and resource distribution.

**Security and Compliance:**
- **Customer-Managed Keys:** Implement customer-managed keys for data encryption at rest, ensuring each tenant’s data is securely isolated.
- **Regular Key Rotation:** Enhance security by regularly rotating encryption keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

### Real-world example: implementing ResearchHub

**Partition Key-Per-Tenant:**
- **Assign Partition Keys:** Each organization (tenant) is assigned a unique partition key.
- **Data Storage:** All researchers’ data for a tenant is stored within its partition, ensuring logical separation.
- **Query Optimization:** Queries are executed using the tenant's partition key, enhancing performance by isolating data access.

**Hierarchical Partitioning:**
- **Multi-Level Partition Keys:** Data within a tenant’s partition is further segmented by "DepartmentId" and "ResearcherId" or other relevant attributes.
- **Granular Data Management:** This hierarchical approach allows ResearchHub to manage and query data more efficiently, reducing latency, and improving response times.

**Account-Per-Tenant:**
- **Separate Cosmos DB Accounts:** High-profile clients or those with sensitive data are provided individual Cosmos DB accounts.
- **Custom Configurations:** Resources and SLAs are tailored to meet the specific needs of each tenant, ensuring optimal performance and security.
- **Enhanced Data Security:** Physical separation of data with customer-managed encryption keys ensures robust security compliance.

## Conclusion

Multi-tenancy in Azure Cosmos DB, especially with its DiskANN vector index capability, offers a powerful solution for building scalable, high-performance AI applications.

# Build a RAG chatbot with Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API

In this guide, we demonstrate how to build a [RAG Pattern](../gen-ai/rag.md) application using a subset of the Movie Lens dataset. This sample leverages the Python SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL to perform vector search for RAG, store and retrieve chat history, and store vectors of the chat history to use as a semantic cache. Azure OpenAI is used to generate embeddings and Large Language Model (LLM) completions.

At the end, we create a simple UX using Gradio to allow users to type in questions and display responses generated by Azure OpenAI or served from the cache. The responses will also display an elapsed time to show the impact caching has on performance versus generating a response.

openai_client = AzureOpenAI(azure_endpoint=openai_endpoint, api_key=openai_key, api_version=openai_api_version)
```

## 3. Create a Database and Containers with Vector Policies

This function takes a database object, a collection name, the name of the document property that stores vectors, and the number of vector dimensions used for the embeddings.

```python
db = cosmos_client.create_database_if_not_exists(cosmos_database)

# Create the vector embedding policy to specify vector details
vector_embedding_policy = {
    "vectorEmbeddings": [ 
        { 
            "path":"/" + cosmos_vector_property,
            "dataType":"float32",
            "distanceFunction":"cosine",
            "dimensions":openai_embeddings_dimensions
        }, 
    ]
}

# Create the vector index policy to specify vector details
indexing_policy = {
    "includedPaths": [ 
    { 
        "path": "/*" 
    } 
    ], 
    "excludedPaths": [ 
    { 
        "path": "/\"_etag\"/?",
        "path": "/" + cosmos_vector_property + "/*",
    } 
    ], 
    "vectorIndexes": [ 
        {
            "path": "/"+cosmos_vector_property, 
            "type": "quantizedFlat" 
        }
    ]
} 

# Create the data collection with vector index (note: this creates a container with 10000 RUs to allow fast data load)
try:
    movies_container = db.create_container_if_not_exists(id=cosmos_collection, 
                                                  partition_key=PartitionKey(path='/id'),
                                                  indexing_policy=indexing_policy, 
                                                  vector_embedding_policy=vector_embedding_policy,
                                                  offer_throughput=10000) 
    print('Container with id \'{0}\' created'.format(movies_container.id)) 

except exceptions.CosmosHttpResponseError: 
    raise 

# Create the cache collection with vector index
try:
    cache_container = db.create_container_if_not_exists(id=cosmos_cache, 
                                                  partition_key=PartitionKey(path='/id'), 
                                                  indexing_policy=indexing_policy,
                                                  vector_embedding_policy=vector_embedding_policy,
                                                  offer_throughput=1000) 
    print('Container with id \'{0}\' created'.format(cache_container.id)) 

except exceptions.CosmosHttpResponseError: 
    raise
```

## 4. Generate Embeddings from Azure OpenAI

This function vectorizes the user input for vector search. Ensure the dimensionality and model used match the sample data provided, or else regenerate vectors with your desired model.

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_random_exponential 
import logging
@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=2, max=300), stop=stop_after_attempt(20))
def generate_embeddings(text):
    try:        
        response = openai_client.embeddings.create(
            input=text,
            model=openai_embeddings_deployment,
            dimensions=openai_embeddings_dimensions
        )
        embeddings = response.model_dump()
        return embeddings['data'][0]['embedding']
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the exception with traceback for easier debugging
        logging.error("An error occurred while generating embeddings.", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

## 5. Load Data from the JSON File

Extract the prevectorized MovieLens dataset from the zip file (see its location in notebook repo [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples/tree/main/DataSet/Movies)).

```python
# Unzip the data file
with zipfile.ZipFile("../../DataSet/Movies/MovieLens-4489-256D.zip", 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("/Data")
zip_ref.close()

# Load the data file
data = []
with open('/Data/MovieLens-4489-256D.json', 'r') as d:
    data = json.load(d)

# View the number of documents in the data (4489)
len(data)
```

## 6. Store Data in Azure Cosmos DB

Upsert data into Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. Records are written asynchronously.

```python
#The following code to get raw movies data is commented out in favour of
#getting prevectorized data. If you want to vectorize the raw data from
#storage_file_url, uncomment the below, and set vectorizeFlag=True

#data = urllib.request.urlopen(storage_file_url)
#data = json.load(data)

vectorizeFlag=False

import asyncio
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def generate_vectors(items, vector_property):
    # Create a thread pool executor for the synchronous generate_embeddings
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    
    # Define a function to call generate_embeddings using run_in_executor
    async def generate_embedding_for_item(item):
        try:
            # Offload the sync generate_embeddings to a thread
            vectorArray = await loop.run_in_executor(None, generate_embeddings, item['overview'])
            item[vector_property] = vectorArray
        except Exception as e:
            # Log or handle exceptions if needed
            logging.error(f"Error generating embedding for item: {item['overview'][:50]}...", exc_info=True)
    
    # Create tasks for all the items to generate embeddings concurrently
    tasks = [generate_embedding_for_item(item) for item in items]
    
    # Run all the tasks concurrently and wait for their completion
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    return items

async def insert_data(vectorize=False):
    start_time = time.time()  # Record the start time
    
    # If vectorize flag is True, generate vectors for the data
    if vectorize:
        print("Vectorizing data, please wait...")
        global data
        data = await generate_vectors(data, "vector")

    counter = 0
    tasks = []
    max_concurrency = 5  # Adjust this value to control the level of concurrency
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrency)
    print("Starting doc load, please wait...")
    
    def upsert_item_sync(obj):
        movies_container.upsert_item(body=obj)
    
    async def upsert_object(obj):
        nonlocal counter
        async with semaphore:
            await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, upsert_item_sync, obj)
            # Progress reporting
            counter += 1
            if counter % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Sent {counter} documents for insertion into collection.")
    
    for obj in data:
        tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(upsert_object(obj)))
    
    # Run all upsert tasks concurrently within the limits set by the semaphore
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    end_time = time.time()  # Record the end time
    duration = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the duration
    print(f"All {counter} documents inserted!")
    print(f"Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds ({duration:.3f} milliseconds)")

# Run the async function with the vectorize flag set to True or False as needed
await insert_data(vectorizeFlag)  # or await insert_data() for default
```

## 7. Perform Vector Search

This function defines a vector search over the movies data and chat cache collections.

```python
def vector_search(container, vectors, similarity_score=0.02, num_results=5):
    results = container.query_items(
        query='''
        SELECT TOP @num_results c.overview, VectorDistance(c.vector, @embedding) as SimilarityScore 
        FROM c
        WHERE VectorDistance(c.vector,@embedding) > @similarity_score
        ORDER BY VectorDistance(c.vector,@embedding)
        ''',
        parameters=[
            {"name": "@embedding", "value": vectors},
            {"name": "@num_results", "value": num_results},
            {"name": "@similarity_score", "value": similarity_score}
        ],
        enable_cross_partition_query=True,
        populate_query_metrics=True
    )
    results = list(results)
    formatted_results = [{'SimilarityScore': result.pop('SimilarityScore'), 'document': result} for result in results]

    return formatted_results
```

## 8. Get Recent Chat History

This function provides conversational context to the LLM, allowing it to better have a conversation with the user.

```python
def get_chat_history(container, completions=3):
    results = container.query_items(
        query='''
        SELECT TOP @completions *
        FROM c
        ORDER BY c._ts DESC
        ''',
        parameters=[
            {"name": "@completions", "value": completions},
        ],
        enable_cross_partition_query=True
    )
    results = list(results)
    return results
```

## 9. Chat Completion Functions

Define the functions to handle the chat completion process, including caching responses.

```python
def generate_completion(user_prompt, vector_search_results, chat_history):
    system_prompt = '''
    You are an intelligent assistant for movies. You are designed to provide helpful answers to user questions about movies in your database.
    You are friendly, helpful, and informative and can be lighthearted. Be concise in your responses, but still friendly.
     - Only answer questions related to the information provided below. Provide at least 3 candidate movie answers in a list.
     - Write two lines of whitespace between each answer in the list.
    '''

    messages = [{'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt}]
    for chat in chat_history:
        messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': chat['prompt'] + " " + chat['completion']})
    messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': user_prompt})
    for result in vector_search_results:
        messages.append({'role': 'system', 'content': json.dumps(result['document'])})

    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=openai_completions_deployment,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.1
    )    
    return response.model_dump()

def chat_completion(cache_container, movies_container, user_input):
    print("starting completion")
    # Generate embeddings from the user input
    user_embeddings = generate_embeddings(user_input)
    # Query the chat history cache first to see if this question has been asked before
    cache_results = get_cache(container=cache_container, vectors=user_embeddings, similarity_score=0.99, num_results=1)
    if len(cache_results) > 0:
        print("Cached Result\n")
        return cache_results[0]['completion'], True
        
    else:
        # Perform vector search on the movie collection
        print("New result\n")
        search_results = vector_search(movies_container, user_embeddings)

        print("Getting Chat History\n")
        # Chat history
        chat_history = get_chat_history(cache_container, 3)
        # Generate the completion
        print("Generating completions \n")
        completions_results = generate_completion(user_input, search_results, chat_history)

        print("Caching response \n")
        # Cache the response
        cache_response(cache_container, user_input, user_embeddings, completions_results)

        print("\n")
        # Return the generated LLM completion
        return completions_results['choices'][0]['message']['content'], False
```

## 10. Cache Generated Responses

Save the user prompts and generated completions to the cache for faster future responses.

```python
def cache_response(container, user_prompt, prompt_vectors, response):
    chat_document = {
        'id': str(uuid.uuid4()),
        'prompt': user_prompt,
        'completion': response['choices'][0]['message']['content'],
        'completionTokens': str(response['usage']['completion_tokens']),
        'promptTokens': str(response['usage']['prompt_tokens']),
        'totalTokens': str(response['usage']['total_tokens']),
        'model': response['model'],
        'vector': prompt_vectors
    }
    container.create_item(body=chat_document)

def get_cache(container, vectors, similarity_score=0.0, num_results=5):
    # Execute the query
    results = container.query_items(
        query= '''
        SELECT TOP @num_results *
        FROM c
        WHERE VectorDistance(c.vector,@embedding) > @similarity_score
        ORDER BY VectorDistance(c.vector,@embedding)
        ''',
        parameters=[
            {"name": "@embedding", "value": vectors},
            {"name": "@num_results", "value": num_results},
            {"name": "@similarity_score", "value": similarity_score},
        ],
        enable_cross_partition_query=True, populate_query_metrics=True)
    results = list(results)
    return results
```

## 11. Create a Simple UX in Gradio

Build a user interface using Gradio for interacting with the AI application.

```python
chat_history = []

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    chatbot = gr.Chatbot(label="Cosmic Movie Assistant")
    msg = gr.Textbox(label="Ask me about movies in the Cosmic Movie Database!")
    clear = gr.Button("Clear")

    def user(user_message, chat_history):
        start_time = time.time()
        response_payload, cached = chat_completion(cache_container, movies_container, user_message)
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = round((end
        time - start_time) * 1000, 2)
        details = f"\n (Time: {elapsed_time}ms)"
        if cached:
            details += " (Cached)"
        chat_history.append([user_message, response_payload + details])
        
        return gr.update(value=""), chat_history
    
    msg.submit(user, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot], queue=False)
    clear.click(lambda: None, None, chatbot, queue=False)

# Launch the Gradio interface
demo.launch(debug=True)

# Be sure to run this cell to close or restart the Gradio demo
demo.close()
```

# Load and process document files into Azure Cosmos DB for search

> [!NOTE]
> Document ingestion for Azure Cosmos DB is in private preview. If you're interested to join the preview, we encourage you to join the wait list by signing this form: https://aka.ms/Doc2CDBSignup

We introduce Doc2CDB for Azure Cosmos DB, a powerful accelerator designed to streamline the extraction, preprocessing, and management of large volumes of text data for vector similarity search. This solution uses the advanced vector indexing capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB and is powered by Azure AI Services to provide a robust and efficient pipeline that’s easily to set up and perfect for many use cases including:

- Vector Similarity Search over Text Data. Extract and vectorize text from document data to store in Azure Cosmos DB, makes it easy for you to perform semantic search to find documents that are contextually related to your queries. This allows them to discover relevant information that might not be found through traditional keyword searches, facilitating more comprehensive data retrieval.

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over Documents. Personalize your Small and Large Language Models to your data with RAG. By extracting text from document files, chunking and vectorizing the data, then storing it in Azure Cosmos DB, you’re then set up to empower the chatbot to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses to your scenarios. When you ask a question, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant text chunks through vector search and uses them to generate an answer, grounded in your document data.

:::image type="content" source="../media/gen-ai/document-ingestion/document-ingestion-pipeline.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Cosmos AI Graph infrastructure, components, and flow.":::

## The end-to-end pipeline

Doc2CDB includes several key stages in its pipeline:
1. File Upload to Azure Blob Storage
   - The process begins with uploading documents to Azure Blob Storage. This stage ensures that your files are securely stored and easily accessible for further processing. This is compatible with PDFs, Microsoft Office documents (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, HTML), and Images (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, HEIF).
2. Text Extraction
   - Once the files are uploaded, the next step is text extraction. This involves parsing text data and performing OCR on documents using Azure Document Intelligence, to extract text that can be processed and indexed in Azure Cosmos DB. This stage is crucial for preparing the data for subsequent processing.
3. Text Chunking
   - After extraction, the raw text is broken down into manageable chunks. This chunking process is essential for enabling Small and Large Language Models (SLMs/LLMs) in Azure AI to process the text efficiently. By dividing the text into smaller pieces, we ensure that the data is more accessible and easier to handle.
4. Text Embedding
   - In this stage, Azure OpenAI Service’s text-3-embedding-large model is used to produce vector embeddings of the text chunks. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing for more sophisticated and accurate searches. The embeddings are a critical component for enabling advanced search capabilities.
5. Text Storage
   - Finally, each text chunk, along with its corresponding vector embedding, is stored in an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container as a unique document. This container is configured to perform efficient vector searches and, eventually, full-text searches. By using Azure Cosmos DB’s powerful vector indexing and search capabilities, users can quickly and easily retrieve relevant information from their text data.

## Benefits of the Doc2CDB solution accelerator

- Scalability: Handle large volumes of text data with ease, thanks to the scalable nature of Azure AI services and Azure Cosmos DB
- Efficiency: Streamline the text processing pipeline, reducing the time and effort required to manage and search text data. This is preconfigured for you
- Advanced Search Capabilities: Utilize ultra-fast and efficient Vector Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB perform vector search to find the most semantically relevant data from your documents

# Retrieval Augmented Generated (RAG) with vector search and knowledge graphs using Azure Cosmos DB

[CosmosAIGraph](https://aka.ms/cosmosaigraph) is an innovative solution that applies the power of Azure Cosmos DB to create AI-powered knowledge graphs. This technology integrates advanced graph database capabilities with AI to provide a robust platform for managing and querying complex data relationships. By utilizing Cosmos DB's scalability and performance in both document and vector form, Cosmos AI Graph enables the creation of sophisticated data models that can answer various data questions and uncover hidden relationships and concepts in semi-structured data.

## Questions knowledge graphs help to answer

- **Complex Relationship Queries**:
  - *Question*: "What are the direct and indirect connections between Person A and Person B within a social network?"
  - *Explanation*: Graph RAG can traverse the graph to find all paths and relationships between two nodes, providing a detailed map of connections, which is difficult for Vector Search as it doesn't have authoritative/curated view of relationships between entities.

- **Hierarchical Data Queries**:
  - *Question*: "What is the organizational hierarchy from the CEO down to the entry-level employees in this company?"
  - *Explanation*: Graph RAG can efficiently navigate hierarchical structures, identifying parent-child relationships and levels within the hierarchy, whereas Vector Search is more suited for finding similar items rather than understanding hierarchical relationships.

- **Contextual Path Queries**:
  - *Question*: "What are the steps involved in the supply chain from raw material procurement to the final product delivery?"
  - *Explanation*: Graph RAG can follow the specific paths and dependencies within a supply chain graph, providing a step-by-step breakdown. Vector Search, while excellent at finding similar items, lacks the capability to follow and understand the sequence of steps in a process.

When it comes to [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](rag.md), combining **Knowledge Graphs** and **Vector Search** can offer powerful capabilities that expand the range of questions that can be answered about the data. Graph RAG enhances the retrieval process by using the structured relationships within a graph, making it ideal for applications that require contextual understanding and complex querying, such as knowledge management systems and personalized content delivery. On the other hand, Vector Search excels in handling unstructured data and finding similarities based on vector embeddings, which is useful for tasks like image and document retrieval. Together, these technologies can provide a comprehensive solution that combines the strengths of both structured and unstructured data processing.

:::image type="content" source="../media/gen-ai/cosmos-ai-graph/cosmos-ai-graph-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Cosmos AI Graph infrastructure, components, and flow.":::

## OmniRAG

CosmosAIGraph features *OmniRAG*, a versatile approach to data retrieval that dynamically selects the most suitable method — be it database queries, vector matching, or knowledge graph traversal — to answer user queries effectively and with utmost accuracy, as it likely will gather more context and more authoritative conext than any one of these sources could on its own. The key to this dynamic selection is the user intent - determined from the user question using simple utterance analysis and/or AI. This ensures that each query is addressed using the optimal technique, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. For instance, a user query about hierarchical relationships would utilize graph traversal, while a query about similar documents would employ vector search, all within a unified framework provided by CosmosAIGraph. Moreover, with the help of orchestration of within RAG process, more than one source could be used to collect the context for AI, for example the graph could be consulted with first and then for each of the entities found the actual database records could be pulled as well and if no results were found, vector search would likely return closely matching results. This holistic approach maximizes the strengths of each retrieval method, delivering comprehensive and contextually relevant answers.

# AI agents in Azure Cosmos DB

AI agents are designed to perform specific tasks, answer questions, and automate processes for users. These agents vary widely in complexity. They range from simple chatbots, to copilots, to advanced AI assistants in the form of digital or robotic systems that can run complex workflows autonomously.

This article provides conceptual overviews and detailed implementation samples for AI agents.

## What are AI agents?

Unlike standalone large language models (LLMs) or rule-based software/hardware systems, AI agents have these common features:

- **Planning**: AI agents can plan and sequence actions to achieve specific goals. The integration of LLMs has revolutionized their planning capabilities.
- **Tool usage**: Advanced AI agents can use various tools, such as code execution, search, and computation capabilities, to perform tasks effectively. AI agents often use tools through function calling.
- **Perception**: AI agents can perceive and process information from their environment, to make them more interactive and context aware. This information includes visual, auditory, and other sensory data.
- **Memory**: AI agents have the ability to remember past interactions (tool usage and perception) and behaviors (tool usage and planning). They store these experiences and even perform self-reflection to inform future actions. This memory component allows for continuity and improvement in agent performance over time.

> [!NOTE]
> The usage of the term *memory* in the context of AI agents is different from the concept of computer memory (like volatile, nonvolatile, and persistent memory).

### Copilots

Copilots are a type of AI agent. They work alongside users rather than operating independently. Unlike fully automated agents, copilots provide suggestions and recommendations to assist users in completing tasks.

For instance, when a user is writing an email, a copilot might suggest phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. The user might also ask the copilot to find relevant information in other emails or files to support the suggestion (see [retrieval-augmented generation](vector-database.md#retrieval-augmented-generation)). The user can accept, reject, or edit the suggested passages.

### Autonomous agents

Autonomous agents can operate more independently. When you set up autonomous agents to assist with email composition, you could enable them to perform the following tasks:

- Consult existing emails, chats, files, and other internal and public information that's related to the subject matter.
- Perform qualitative or quantitative analysis on the collected information, and draw conclusions that are relevant to the email.
- Write the complete email based on the conclusions and incorporate supporting evidence.
- Attach relevant files to the email.
- Review the email to ensure that all the incorporated information is factually accurate and that the assertions are valid.
- Select the appropriate recipients for **To**, **Cc**, and **Bcc**, and look up their email addresses.
- Schedule an appropriate time to send the email.
- Perform follow-ups if responses are expected but not received.

You can configure the agents to perform each of the preceding tasks with or without human approval.

### Multi-agent systems

A popular strategy for achieving performant autonomous agents is the use of multi-agent systems. In multi-agent systems, multiple autonomous agents, whether in digital or robotic form, interact or work together to achieve individual or collective goals. Agents in the system can operate independently and possess their own knowledge or information. Each agent might also have the capability to perceive its environment, make decisions, and execute actions based on its objectives.

Multi-agent systems have these key characteristics:

- **Autonomous**: Each agent functions independently. It makes its own decisions without direct human intervention or control by other agents.
- **Interactive**: Agents communicate and collaborate with each other to share information, negotiate, and coordinate their actions. This interaction can occur through various protocols and communication channels.
- **Goal-oriented**: Agents in a multi-agent system are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be aligned with individual objectives or a shared objective among the agents.
- **Distributed**: Multi-agent systems operate in a distributed manner, with no single point of control. This distribution enhances the system's robustness, scalability, and resource efficiency.

A multi-agent system provides the following advantages over a copilot or a single instance of LLM inference:

- **Dynamic reasoning**: Compared to chain-of-thought or tree-of-thought prompting, multi-agent systems allow for dynamic navigation through various reasoning paths.
- **Sophisticated abilities**: Multi-agent systems can handle complex or large-scale problems by conducting thorough decision-making processes and distributing tasks among multiple agents.
- **Enhanced memory**: Multi-agent systems with memory can overcome the context windows of LLMs to enable better understanding and information retention.

## Implementation of AI agents

### Reasoning and planning

Complex reasoning and planning are the hallmark of advanced autonomous agents. Popular frameworks for autonomous agents incorporate one or more of the following methodologies (with links to arXiv archive pages) for reasoning and planning:

- [Self-Ask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350)

  Improve on chain of thought by having the model explicitly ask itself (and answer) follow-up questions before answering the initial question.

- [Reason and Act (ReAct)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

  Use LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. Reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans, along with handling exceptions. Actions allow the model to connect with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information.

- [Plan and Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091)

  Devise a plan to divide the entire task into smaller subtasks, and then carry out the subtasks according to the plan. This approach mitigates the calculation errors, missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors that are often present in zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

- [Reflect/Self-critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)

  Use *reflexion* agents that verbally reflect on task feedback signals. These agents maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials.

### Frameworks

Various frameworks and tools can facilitate the development and deployment of AI agents.

For tool usage and perception that don't require sophisticated planning and memory, some popular LLM orchestrator frameworks are LangChain, LlamaIndex, Prompt Flow, and Semantic Kernel.

For advanced and autonomous planning and execution workflows, [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) propelled the multi-agent wave that began in late 2022. OpenAI's [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) allows its users to create agents natively within the GPT ecosystem. [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/) and [LlamaIndex Agents](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/use_cases/agents/) also emerged around the same time.

> [!TIP]
> The [implementation sample](#implementation-sample) later in this article shows how to build a simple multi-agent system by using one of the popular frameworks and a unified agent memory system.

### AI agent memory system

The prevalent practice for experimenting with AI-enhanced applications from 2022 through 2024 has been using standalone database management systems for various data workflows or types. For example, you can use an in-memory database for caching, a relational database for operational data (including tracing/activity logs and LLM conversation history), and a [pure vector database](vector-database.md#integrated-vector-database-vs-pure-vector-database) for embedding management.

However, this practice of using a complex web of standalone databases can hurt an AI agent's performance. Integrating all these disparate databases into a cohesive, interoperable, and resilient memory system for AI agents is its own challenge.

Also, many of the frequently used database services are not optimal for the speed and scalability that AI agent systems need. These databases' individual weaknesses are exacerbated in multi-agent systems.

#### In-memory databases

In-memory databases are excellent for speed but might struggle with the large-scale data persistence that AI agents need.

#### Relational databases

Relational databases are not ideal for the varied modalities and fluid schemas of data that agents handle. Relational databases require manual efforts and even downtime to manage provisioning, partitioning, and sharding.

#### Pure vector databases

Pure vector databases tend to be less effective for transactional operations, real-time updates, and distributed workloads. The popular pure vector databases nowadays typically offer:

- No guarantee on reads and writes.
- Limited ingestion throughput.
- Low availability (below 99.9%, or an annualized outage of 9 hours or more).
- One consistency level (eventual).
- A resource-intensive in-memory vector index.
- Limited options for multitenancy.
- Limited security.

## Characteristics of a robust AI agent memory system

Just as efficient database management systems are critical to the performance of software applications, it's critical to provide LLM-powered agents with relevant and useful information to guide their inference. Robust memory systems enable organizing and storing various kinds of information that the agents can retrieve at inference time.

Currently, LLM-powered applications often use [retrieval-augmented generation](vector-database.md#retrieval-augmented-generation) that uses basic semantic search or vector search to retrieve passages or documents. [Vector search](vector-database.md#vector-search) can be useful for finding general information. But vector search might not capture the specific context, structure, or relationships that are relevant for a particular task or domain.

For example, if the task is to write code, vector search might not be able to retrieve the syntax tree, file system layout, code summaries, or API signatures that are important for generating coherent and correct code. Similarly, if the task is to work with tabular data, vector search might not be able to retrieve the schema, the foreign keys, the stored procedures, or the reports that are useful for querying or analyzing the data.

Weaving together a web of standalone in-memory, relational, and vector databases (as described [earlier](#ai-agent-memory-system)) is not an optimal solution for the varied data types. This approach might work for prototypical agent systems. However, it adds complexity and performance bottlenecks that can hamper the performance of advanced autonomous agents.

A robust memory system should have the following characteristics.

### Multimodal

AI agent memory systems should provide collections that store metadata, relationships, entities, summaries, or other types of information that can be useful for various tasks and domains. These collections can be based on the structure and format of the data, such as documents, tables, or code. Or they can be based on the content and meaning of the data, such as concepts, associations, or procedural steps.

Memory systems aren't just critical to AI agents. They're also important for the humans who develop, maintain, and use these agents.

For example, humans might need to supervise agents' planning and execution workflows in near real time. While supervising, humans might interject with guidance or make in-line edits of agents' dialogues or monologues. Humans might also need to audit the reasoning and actions of agents to verify the validity of the final output.

Human/agent interactions are likely in natural or programming languages, whereas agents "think," "learn," and "remember" through embeddings. This difference poses another requirement on memory systems' consistency across data modalities.

### Operational

Memory systems should provide memory banks that store information that's relevant for the interaction with the user and the environment. Such information might include chat history, user preferences, sensory data, decisions made, facts learned, or other operational data that's updated with high frequency and at high volumes.

These memory banks can help the agents remember short-term and long-term information, avoid repeating or contradicting themselves, and maintain task coherence. These requirements must hold true even if the agents perform a multitude of unrelated tasks in succession. In advanced cases, agents might also test numerous branch plans that diverge or converge at different points.

### Sharable but also separable

At the macro level, memory systems should enable multiple AI agents to collaborate on a problem or process different aspects of the problem by providing shared memory that's accessible to all the agents. Shared memory can facilitate the exchange of information and the coordination of actions among the agents.

At the same time, the memory system must allow agents to preserve their own persona and characteristics, such as their unique collections of prompts and memories.

## Building a robust AI agent memory system

The preceding characteristics require AI agent memory systems to be highly scalable and swift. Painstakingly weaving together disparate in-memory, relational, and vector databases (as described [earlier](#ai-agent-memory-system)) might work for early-stage AI-enabled applications. However, this approach adds complexity and performance bottlenecks that can hamper the performance of advanced autonomous agents.

In place of all the standalone databases, Azure Cosmos DB can serve as a unified solution for AI agent memory systems. Its robustness successfully [enabled OpenAI's ChatGPT service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IIUtEFKJec&t) to scale dynamically with high reliability and low maintenance. Powered by an atom-record-sequence engine, it's the world's first globally distributed [NoSQL](distributed-nosql.md), [relational](distributed-relational.md), and [vector database](vector-database.md) service that offers a serverless mode. AI agents built on top of Azure Cosmos DB offer speed, scale, and simplicity.

### Speed

Azure Cosmos DB provides single-digit millisecond latency. This capability makes it suitable for processes that require rapid data access and management. These processes include caching (both traditional and semantic caching, transactions, and operational workloads.

Low latency is crucial for AI agents that need to perform complex reasoning, make real-time decisions, and provide immediate responses. In addition, the service's [use of the DiskANN algorithm](nosql/vector-search.md#enable-the-vector-indexing-and-search-feature) provides accurate and fast vector search with minimal memory consumption.

### Scale

Azure Cosmos DB is engineered for global distribution and horizontal scalability. It offers support for multiple-region I/O and multitenancy.

The service helps ensure that memory systems can expand seamlessly and keep up with rapidly growing agents and associated data. The [availability guarantee in its service-level agreement (SLA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services) translates to less than 5 minutes of downtime per year. Pure vector database services, by contrast, come with 9 hours or more of downtime. This availability provides a solid foundation for mission-critical workloads. At the same time, the various service models in Azure Cosmos DB, like [Reserved Capacity](reserved-capacity.md) or Serverless, can help reduce financial costs.

### Simplicity

Azure Cosmos DB can simplify data management and architecture by integrating multiple database functionalities into a single, cohesive platform.

Its integrated vector database capabilities can store, index, and query embeddings alongside the corresponding data in natural or programming languages. This capability enables greater data consistency, scale, and performance.

Its flexibility supports the varied modalities and fluid schemas of the metadata, relationships, entities, summaries, chat history, user preferences, sensory data, decisions, facts learned, or other operational data involved in agent workflows. The database automatically indexes all data without requiring schema or index management, which helps AI agents perform complex queries quickly and efficiently.

Azure Cosmos DB is fully managed, which eliminates the overhead of database administration tasks like scaling, patching, and backups. Without this overhead, developers can focus on building and optimizing AI agents without worrying about the underlying data infrastructure.

### Advanced features

Azure Cosmos DB incorporates advanced features such as change feed, which allows tracking and responding to changes in data in real time. This capability is useful for AI agents that need to react to new information promptly.

Additionally, the built-in support for multi-master writes enables high availability and resilience to help ensure continuous operation of AI agents, even after regional failures.

The five available [consistency levels](consistency-levels.md) (from strong to eventual) can also cater to various distributed workloads, depending on the scenario requirements.

## Implementation sample

This section explores the implementation of an autonomous agent to process traveler inquiries and bookings in a travel application for a cruise line.

Chatbots are a long-standing concept, but AI agents are advancing beyond basic human conversation to carry out tasks based on natural language. These tasks traditionally required coded logic. The AI travel agent in this implementation sample uses the LangChain Agent framework for agent planning, tool usage, and perception.

The AI travel agent's [unified memory system](#characteristics-of-a-robust-ai-agent-memory-system) uses the [vector database](vector-database.md) and document store capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB to address traveler inquiries and facilitate trip bookings. Using Azure Cosmos DB for this purpose helps ensure speed, scale, and simplicity, as described [earlier](#building-a-robust-ai-agent-memory-system).

The sample agent operates within a Python FastAPI back end. It supports user interactions through a React JavaScript user interface.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can [try Azure Cosmos DB for free](try-free.md) for 30 days without creating an Azure account. The free trial doesn't require a credit card, and no commitment follows the trial period.
- An account for the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI Service.
- A vCore cluster in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB. You can create one by following [this quickstart](mongodb/vcore/quickstart-portal.md).
- An integrated development environment, such as Visual Studio Code.
- Python 3.11.4 installed in the development environment.

### Download the project

All of the code and sample datasets are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/Travel-AI-Agent-React-FastAPI-and-Cosmos-DB-Vector-Store). The repository includes these folders:

- *loader*: This folder contains Python code for loading sample documents and vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB.
- *api*: This folder contains the Python FastAPI project for hosting the AI travel agent.
- *web*: This folder contains code for the React web interface.

### Load travel documents into Azure Cosmos DB

The GitHub repository contains a Python project in the *loader* directory. It's intended for loading the sample travel documents into Azure Cosmos DB.

#### Set up the environment

Set up your Python virtual environment in the *loader* directory by running the following command:

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate your environment and install dependencies in the *loader* directory:

```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file named *.env* in the *loader* directory, to store the following environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI key>"
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv:<your connection string from Azure Cosmos DB>"
```

#### Load documents and vectors

The Python file *main.py* serves as the central entry point for loading data into Azure Cosmos DB. This code processes the sample travel data from the GitHub repository, including information about ships and destinations. The code also generates travel itinerary packages for each ship and destination, so that travelers can book them by using the AI agent. The CosmosDBLoader tool is responsible for creating collections, vector embeddings, and indexes in the Azure Cosmos DB instance.

Here are the contents of *main.py*:

```python
from cosmosdbloader import CosmosDBLoader
from itinerarybuilder import ItineraryBuilder
import json

cosmosdb_loader = CosmosDBLoader(DB_Name='travel')

#read in ship data
with open('documents/ships.json') as file:
        ship_json = json.load(file)

#read in destination data
with open('documents/destinations.json') as file:
        destinations_json = json.load(file)

builder = ItineraryBuilder(ship_json['ships'],destinations_json['destinations'])

# Create five itinerary packages
itinerary = builder.build(5)

# Save itinerary packages to Cosmos DB
cosmosdb_loader.load_data(itinerary,'itinerary')

# Save destinations to Cosmos DB
cosmosdb_loader.load_data(destinations_json['destinations'],'destinations')

# Save ships to Cosmos DB, create vector store
collection = cosmosdb_loader.load_vectors(ship_json['ships'],'ships')

# Add text search index to ship name
collection.create_index([('name', 'text')])
```

Load the documents, load the vectors, and create indexes by running the following command from the *loader* directory:

```shell
python main.py
```

Here's the output of *main.py*:

```output
--build itinerary--
--load itinerary--
--load destinations--
--load vectors ships--
```

### Build the AI travel agent by using Python FastAPI

The AI travel agent is hosted in a back end API through Python FastAPI, which facilitates integration with the front-end user interface. The API project processes agent requests by grounding the LLM prompts against the data layer, specifically the vectors and documents in Azure Cosmos DB.

The agent makes use of various tools, particularly the Python functions provided at the API service layer. This article focuses on the code necessary for AI agents within the API code.

The API project in the GitHub repository is structured as follows:

- *Data modeling components* use Pydantic models.
- *Web layer components* are responsible for routing requests and managing communication.
- *Service layer components* are responsible for primary business logic and interaction with the data layer, the LangChain Agent, and agent tools.
- *Data layer components* are responsible for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB document storage and vector search.

### Set up the environment for the API

We used Python version 3.11.4 for the development and testing of the API.

Set up your Python virtual environment in the *api* directory:

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate your environment and install dependencies by using the *requirements* file in the *api* directory:

```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file named *.env* in the *api* directory, to store your environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your Open AI key>"
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv:<your connection string from Azure Cosmos DB>"
```

Now that you've configured the environment and set up variables, run the following command from the *api* directory to initiate the server:

```shell
python app.py
```

The FastAPI server starts on the localhost loopback 127.0.0.1 port 8000 by default. You can access the Swagger documents by using the following localhost address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Use a session for the AI agent memory

It's imperative for the travel agent to be able to reference previously provided information within the ongoing conversation. This ability is commonly known as *memory* in the context of LLMs.

To achieve this objective, use the chat message history that's stored in the Azure Cosmos DB instance. The history for each chat session is stored through a session ID to ensure that only messages from the current conversation session are accessible. This necessity is the reason behind the existence of a `Get Session` method in the API. It's a placeholder method for managing web sessions to illustrate the use of chat message history.

Select **Try it out** for `/session/`.

:::image type="content" source="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/fastapi-get-session.png" lightbox="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/fastapi-get-session.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the use of the Get Session method in Python FastAPI, with the button for trying it out.":::

```json
{
  "session_id": "0505a645526f4d68a3603ef01efaab19"
}
```

For the AI agent, you only need to simulate a session. The stubbed-out method merely returns a generated session ID for tracking message history. In a practical implementation, this session would be stored in Azure Cosmos DB and potentially in React `localStorage`.

Here are the contents of *web/session.py*:

```python
@router.get("/")
def get_session():
    return {'session_id':str(uuid.uuid4().hex)}
```

### Start a conversation with the AI travel agent

Use the session ID that you obtained from the previous step to start a new dialogue with the AI agent, so you can validate its functionality. Conduct the test by submitting the following phrase: "I want to take a relaxing vacation."

Select **Try it out** for `/agent/agent_chat`.

:::image type="content" source="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/fastapi-agent-chat.png" lightbox="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/fastapi-agent-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the use of the Agent Chat method in Python FastAPI, with the button for trying it out.":::

Use this example parameter:

```json
{
  "input": "I want to take a relaxing vacation.",
  "session_id": "0505a645526f4d68a3603ef01efaab19"
}
```

The initial execution results in a recommendation for the Tranquil Breeze Cruise and the Fantasy Seas Adventure Cruise, because the agent anticipates that they're the most relaxing cruises available through the vector search. These documents have the highest score for `similarity_search_with_score` called in the data layer of the API, `data.mongodb.travel.similarity_search()`.

The similarity search scores appear as output from the API for debugging purposes. Here's the output after a call to `data.mongodb.travel.similarity_search()`:

```output
0.8394561085977978
0.8086545112328692
2
```

> [!TIP]
> If documents are not being returned for vector search, modify the `similarity_search_with_score` limit or the score filter value as needed (`[doc for doc, score  in docs if score >=.78]`) in `data.mongodb.travel.similarity_search()`.

Calling `agent_chat` for the first time creates a new collection named `history` in Azure Cosmos DB to store the conversation by session. This call enables the agent to access the stored chat message history as needed. Subsequent executions of `agent_chat` with the same parameters produce varying results, because it draws from memory.

### Walk through the AI agent

When you're integrating the AI agent into the API, the web search components are responsible for initiating all requests. The web search components are followed by the search service, and finally the data components.

In this specific case, you use a MongoDB data search that connects to Azure Cosmos DB. The layers facilitate the exchange of model components, with the AI agent and the AI agent tool code residing in the service layer. This approach enables the seamless interchangeability of data sources. It also extends the capabilities of the AI agent with additional, more intricate functionalities or tools.

:::image type="content" source="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/travel-ai-agent-fastapi-layers.png" lightbox="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/travel-ai-agent-fastapi-layers.png" alt-text="Diagram of the FastAPI layers of the AI travel agent.":::

#### Service layer

The service layer forms the cornerstone of core business logic. In this particular scenario, the service layer plays a crucial role as the repository for the LangChain Agent code. It facilitates the seamless integration of user prompts with Azure Cosmos DB data, conversation memory, and agent functions for the AI agent.

The service layer employs a singleton pattern module for handling agent-related initializations in the *init.py* file. Here are the contents of *service/init.py*:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from os import environ
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_mongodb.chat_message_histories import MongoDBChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_tools_agent
from service import TravelAgentTools as agent_tools

load_dotenv(override=False)

chat : ChatOpenAI | None=None
agent_with_chat_history : RunnableWithMessageHistory | None=None

def LLM_init():
    global chat,agent_with_chat_history
    chat = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",temperature=0)
    tools = [agent_tools.vacation_lookup, agent_tools.itinerary_lookup, agent_tools.book_cruise ]

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful and friendly travel assistant for a cruise company. Answer travel questions to the best of your ability providing only relevant information. In order to book a cruise you will need to capture the person's name.",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),
        ("user", "Answer should be embedded in html tags. {input}"),
         MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
    ]
    )

    #Answer should be embedded in HTML tags. Only answer questions related to cruise travel, If you can not answer respond with \"I am here to assist with your travel questions.\". 


    agent = create_openai_tools_agent(chat, tools, prompt)
    agent_executor  = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

    agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
        agent_executor,
        lambda session_id: MongoDBChatMessageHistory( database_name="travel",
                                                 collection_name="history",
                                                   connection_string=environ.get("MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING"),
                                                   session_id=session_id),
        input_messages_key="input",
        history_messages_key="chat_history",
)

LLM_init()
```

The *init.py* file initiates the loading of environment variables from an *.env* file by using the `load_dotenv(override=False)` method. Then, a global variable named `agent_with_chat_history` is instantiated for the agent. This agent is intended for use by *TravelAgent.py*.

The `LLM_init()` method is invoked during module initialization to configure the AI agent for conversation via the API web layer. The OpenAI `chat` object is instantiated through the GPT-3.5 model and incorporates specific parameters such as model name and temperature. The `chat` object, tools list, and prompt template are combined to generate `AgentExecutor`, which operates as the AI travel agent.

The agent with history, `agent_with_chat_history`, is established through `RunnableWithMessageHistory` with chat history (`MongoDBChatMessageHistory`). This action enables it to maintain a complete conversation history via Azure Cosmos DB.

#### Prompt

The LLM prompt initially began with the simple statement "You are a helpful and friendly travel assistant for a cruise company." However, testing showed that you could obtain more consistent results by including the instruction "Answer travel questions to the best of your ability, providing only relevant information. To book a cruise, capturing the person's name is essential." The results appear in HTML format to enhance the visual appeal of the web interface.

#### Agent tools

[Tools](#what-are-ai-agents) are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world, often through function calling.

When you're creating an agent, you must furnish it with a set of tools that it can use. The `@tool` decorator offers the most straightforward approach to defining a custom tool.

By default, the decorator uses the function name as the tool name, although you can replace it by providing a string as the first argument. The decorator uses the function's docstring as the tool's description, so it requires the provisioning of a docstring.

Here are the contents of *service/TravelAgentTools.py*:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from data.mongodb import travel
from model.travel import Ship


@tool
def vacation_lookup(input:str) -> list[Document]:
    """find information on vacations and trips"""
    ships: list[Ship] = travel.similarity_search(input)
    content = ""

    for ship in ships:
        content += f" Cruise ship {ship.name}  description: {ship.description} with amenities {'/n-'.join(ship.amenities)} "

    return content

@tool
def itinerary_lookup(ship_name:str) -> str:
    """find ship itinerary, cruise packages and destinations by ship name"""
    it = travel.itnerary_search(ship_name)
    results = ""

    for i in it:
        results += f" Cruise Package {i.Name} room prices: {'/n-'.join(i.Rooms)} schedule: {'/n-'.join(i.Schedule)}"

    return results


@tool
def book_cruise(package_name:str, passenger_name:str, room: str )-> str:
    """book cruise using package name and passenger name and room """
    print(f"Package: {package_name} passenger: {passenger_name} room: {room}")

    # LLM defaults empty name to John Doe 
    if passenger_name == "John Doe":
        return "In order to book a cruise I need to know your name."
    else:
        if room == '':
            return "which room would you like to book"            
        return "Cruise has been booked, ref number is 343242"
```

The *TravelAgentTools.py* file defines three tools:

- `vacation_lookup` conducts a vector search against Azure Cosmos DB. It uses `similarity_search` to retrieve relevant travel-related material.
- `itinerary_lookup` retrieves cruise package details and schedules for a specified cruise ship.
- `book_cruise` books a cruise package for a passenger.

Specific instructions ("In order to book a cruise I need to know your name") might be necessary to ensure the capture of the passenger's name and room number for booking the cruise package, even though you included such instructions in the LLM prompt.

#### AI agent

The fundamental concept that underlies agents is to use a language model for selecting a sequence of actions to execute.

Here are the contents of *service/TravelAgent.py*:

```python
from .init import agent_with_chat_history
from model.prompt import PromptResponse
import time
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv(override=False)


def agent_chat(input:str, session_id:str)->str:

    start_time = time.time()

    results=agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": input},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}},
    )

    return  PromptResponse(text=results["output"],ResponseSeconds=(time.time() - start_time))
```

The *TravelAgent.py* file is straightforward, because `agent_with_chat_history` and its dependencies (tools, prompt, and LLM) are initialized and configured in the *init.py* file. This file calls the agent by using the input received from the user, along with the session ID for conversation memory. Afterward, `PromptResponse` (model/prompt) is returned with the agent's output and response time.

## AI agent integration with the React user interface

With the successful loading of the data and accessibility of the AI agent through the API, you can now complete the solution by establishing a web user interface (by using React) for your travel website. Using the capabilities of React helps illustrate the seamless integration of the AI agent into a travel site. This integration enhances the user experience with a conversational travel assistant for inquiries and bookings.

### Set up the environment for React

Install Node.js and the dependencies before testing the React interface.

Run the following command from the *web* directory to perform a clean installation of project dependencies. The installation might take some time.

```shell
npm ci
```

Next, create a file named *.env* within the *web* directory to facilitate the storage of environment variables. Include the following details in the newly created *.env* file:

`REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Now, run the following command from the *web* directory to initiate the React web user interface:

```shell
npm start
```

Running the previous command opens the React web application.

### Walk through the React web interface

The web project of the GitHub repository is a straightforward application to facilitate user interaction with the AI agent. The primary components required to converse with the agent are *TravelAgent.js* and *ChatLayout.js*. The *Main.js* file serves as the central module or user landing page.

:::image type="content" source="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/main.png" lightbox="media/gen-ai/ai-agent/main.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the React JavaScript web interface.":::

#### Main

The main component serves as the central manager of the application. It acts as the designated entry point for routing. Within the render function, it produces JSX code to delineate the main page layout. This layout encompasses placeholder elements for the application, such as logos and links, a section that houses the travel agent component, and a footer that contains a sample disclaimer about the application's nature.

Here are the contents of *main.js*:

```javascript

    )
  }
}

export default Main
```

#### Travel agent

The travel agent component has a straightforward purpose: capturing user inputs and displaying responses. It plays a key role in managing the integration with the back-end AI agent, primarily by capturing sessions and forwarding user prompts to the FastAPI service. The resulting responses are stored in an array for display, facilitated by the chat layout component.

Here are the contents of *TripPlanning/TravelAgent.js*:

```javascript

#### Chat layout

The chat layout component oversees the arrangement of the chat. It systematically processes the chat messages and implements the formatting specified in the `message` JSON object.

Here are the contents of *TripPlanning/ChatLayout.js*:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {  Box, Stack } from '@mui/material'
import parse from 'html-react-parser'
import './ChatLayout.css'

export default function ChatLayout(messages) {
  return (
    <Stack direction="column" spacing="1">
      {messages.messages.map((obj, i = 0) => (
        <div className="bubbleContainer" key={i}>
          <Box
            key={i++}
            className="bubble"
            sx={{ float: obj.direction, fontSize: '10pt', background: obj.bg }}
          >
            <div>{parse(obj.message)}</div>
          </Box>
        </div>
      ))}
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

User prompts are on the right side and colored blue. Responses from the AI travel agent are on the left side and colored green. As the following image shows, the HTML-formatted responses are accounted for in the conversation.

# AI-Enhanced advertisement generation using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

In this guide, we demonstrate how to create dynamic advertising content that resonates with your audience, using our personalized AI assistant, Heelie. Utilizing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, we harness the [vector similarity search](./vector-search.md) functionality to semantically analyze and match inventory descriptions with advertisement topics. The process is made possible by generating vectors for inventory descriptions using OpenAI embeddings, which significantly enhance their semantic depth. These vectors are then stored and indexed within the Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore resource. When generating content for advertisements, we vectorize the advertisement topic to find the best-matching inventory items. This is followed by a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) process, where the top matches are sent to OpenAI to craft a compelling advertisement. The entire codebase for the application is available in a [GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/adgen) for your reference.

## Features

- **Vector Similarity Search**: Uses Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore's powerful vector similarity search to improve semantic search capabilities, making it easier to find relevant inventory items based on the content of advertisements.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Utilizes the cutting-edge embeddings from OpenAI to generate vectors for inventory descriptions. This approach allows for more nuanced and semantically rich matches between the inventory and the advertisement content.
- **Content Generation**: Employs OpenAI's advanced language models to generate engaging, trend-focused advertisements. This method ensures that the content is not only relevant but also captivating to the target audience.

## Prerequisites

- Azure OpenAI: Let's setup the Azure OpenAI resource. Access to this service is currently available by application only. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at https://aka.ms/oai/access. Once you have access, complete the following steps:
  - Create an Azure OpenAI resource following this [quickstart](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).
  - Deploy a `completions` and an `embeddings` model.
    - For more information on `completions`, go [here](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/completions).
    - For more information on `embeddings`, go [here](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings).
  - Note down your endpoint, key, and deployment names.
- Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore resource: Let's start by creating an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore resource for free following this [quick start](./quickstart-portal.md) guide.
  - Note down the connection details.
- Python environment (>= 3.9 version) with packages such as `numpy`, `openai`, `pymongo`, `python-dotenv`, `azure-core`, `azure-cosmos`, `tenacity`, and `gradio`.
- Download the [data file](https://github.com/jayanta-mondal/ignite-demo/blob/main/data/shoes_with_vectors.json) and save it in a designated data folder.

## Running the Script

Before we dive into the exciting part of generating AI-enhanced advertisements, we need to set up our environment. This setup involves installing the necessary packages to ensure our script runs smoothly. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get everything ready.

### 1.1 Install Necessary Packages

Firstly, we need to install a few Python packages. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
 pip install numpy
 pip install openai==1.2.3
 pip install pymongo
 pip install python-dotenv
 pip install azure-core
 pip install azure-cosmos
 pip install tenacity
 pip install gradio
 pip show openai
```

### 1.2 Setting Up the OpenAI and Azure Client

After installing the necessary packages, the next step involves setting up our OpenAI and Azure clients for the script, which is crucial for authenticating our requests to the OpenAI API and Azure services.

```python
import json
import time
import openai

from dotenv import dotenv_values
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# Configure the API to use Azure as the provider
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_key = "<AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY>"  # Replace with your actual Azure OpenAI API key
openai.api_base = "https://<OPENAI_ACCOUNT_NAME>.openai.azure.com/"  # Replace with your OpenAI account name
openai.api_version = "2023-06-01-preview"

# Initialize the AzureOpenAI client with your API key, version, and endpoint
client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_key=openai.api_key,
    api_version=openai.api_version,
    azure_endpoint=openai.api_base
)
```

## Solution architecture

## 2. Creating Embeddings and Setting up Cosmos DB

After setting up our environment and OpenAI client, we move to the core part of our AI-enhanced advertisement generation project. The following code creates vector embeddings from text descriptions of products and sets up our database in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to store and search these embeddings.

### 2.1 Create Embeddings

To generate compelling advertisements, we first need to understand the items in our inventory. We do this by creating vector embeddings from descriptions of our items, which allows us to capture their semantic meaning in a form that machines can understand and process. Here's how you can create vector embeddings for an item description using Azure OpenAI:

```python
import openai

def generate_embeddings(text):
    try:
        response = client.embeddings.create(
            input=text, model="text-embedding-ada-002")
        embeddings = response.data[0].embedding
        return embeddings
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

embeddings = generate_embeddings("Shoes for San Francisco summer")

if embeddings is not None:
    print(embeddings)
```

The function takes a text input — like a product description — and uses the `client.embeddings.create` method from the OpenAI API to generate a vector embedding for that text. We're using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model here, but you can choose other models based on your requirements. If the process is successful, it prints the generated embeddings; otherwise, it handles exceptions by printing an error message.

## 3. Connect and set up Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

With our embeddings ready, the next step is to store and index them in a database that supports vector similarity search. Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore is a perfect fit for this task because it's purpose built to store your transactional data and perform vector search all in one place. 

### 3.1 Set up the connection

To connect to Cosmos DB, we use the pymongo library, which allows us to interact with MongoDB easily. The following code snippet establishes a connection with our Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore instance:

```python
import pymongo

# Replace <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD>, and <VCORE_CLUSTER_NAME> with your actual credentials and cluster name
mongo_conn = "mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<VCORE_CLUSTER_NAME>.mongocluster.cosmos.azure.com/?tls=true&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256&retrywrites=false&maxIdleTimeMS=120000"
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_conn)
```

Replace `<USERNAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, and `<VCORE_CLUSTER_NAME>` with your actual MongoDB username, password, and vCore cluster name, respectively.

## 4. Setting Up the Database and Vector Index in Cosmos DB

Once you've established a connection to Azure Cosmos DB, the next steps involve setting up your database and collection, and then creating a vector index to enable efficient vector similarity searches. Let's walk through these steps.

### 4.1 Set Up the Database and Collection

First, we create a database and a collection within our Cosmos DB instance. Here’s how:

```python
DATABASE_NAME = "AdgenDatabase"
COLLECTION_NAME = "AdgenCollection"

mongo_client.drop_database(DATABASE_NAME)
db = mongo_client[DATABASE_NAME]
collection = db[COLLECTION_NAME]

if COLLECTION_NAME not in db.list_collection_names():
    # Creates a unsharded collection that uses the DBs shared throughput
    db.create_collection(COLLECTION_NAME)
    print("Created collection '{}'.\n".format(COLLECTION_NAME))
else:
    print("Using collection: '{}'.\n".format(COLLECTION_NAME))
```

### 4.2 Create the vector index

To perform efficient vector similarity searches within our collection, we need to create a vector index. Cosmos DB supports different types of [vector indexes](./vector-search.md), and here we discuss two: IVF and HNSW.

### IVF

IVF stands for Inverted File Index, is the default vector indexing algorithm, which works on all cluster tiers. It's an approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) approach that uses clustering to speeding up the search for similar vectors in a dataset. To create an IVF index, use the following command:

```javascript
db.runCommand({
  'createIndexes': 'COLLECTION_NAME',
  'indexes': [
    {
      'name': 'vectorSearchIndex',
      'key': {
        "contentVector": "cosmosSearch"
      },
      'cosmosSearchOptions': {
        'kind': 'vector-ivf',
        'numLists': 1,
        'similarity': 'COS',
        'dimensions': 1536
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You can only create one index per vector property.** That is, you cannot create more than one index that points to the same vector property. If you want to change the index type (e.g., from IVF to HNSW) you must drop the index first before creating a new index.

### HNSW

HNSW stands for Hierarchical Navigable Small World, a graph-based data structure that partitions vectors into clusters and subclusters. With HNSW, you can perform fast approximate nearest neighbor search at higher speeds with greater accuracy. HNSW is an approximate (ANN) method. Here's how to set it up:

```javascript
db.runCommand(
{ 
    "createIndexes": "ExampleCollection",
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": "VectorSearchIndex",
            "key": {
                "contentVector": "cosmosSearch"
            },
            "cosmosSearchOptions": { 
                "kind": "vector-hnsw", 
                "m": 16, # default value 
                "efConstruction": 64, # default value 
                "similarity": "COS", 
                "dimensions": 1536
            } 
        } 
    ] 
}
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> HNSW indexing is only available on M40 cluster tiers and higher.

## 5. Insert data to the collection

Now insert the inventory data, which includes descriptions and their corresponding vector embeddings, into the newly created collection. To insert data into our collection, we use the `insert_many()` method provided by the `pymongo` library. The method allows us to insert multiple documents into the collection at once. Our data is stored in a JSON file, which we'll load and then insert into the database.

Download the [shoes_with_vectors.json](https://github.com/jayanta-mondal/ignite-demo/blob/main/data/shoes_with_vectors.json) file from the GitHub repository and store it in a `data` directory within your project folder.

```python
data_file = open(file="./data/shoes_with_vectors.json", mode="r") 
data = json.load(data_file)
data_file.close()

result = collection.insert_many(data)

print(f"Number of data points added: {len(result.inserted_ids)}")
```

## 6. Vector Search in Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

With our data successfully uploaded, we can now apply the power of vector search to find the most relevant items based on a query. The vector index we created earlier enables us to perform semantic searches within our dataset.

### 6.1 Conducting a Vector Search

To perform a vector search, we define a function `vector_search` that takes a query and the number of results to return. The function generates a vector for the query using the `generate_embeddings` function we defined earlier, then uses Cosmos DB's `$search` functionality to find the closest matching items based on their vector embeddings.

```python
# Function to assist with vector search
def vector_search(query, num_results=3):
    
    query_vector = generate_embeddings(query)

    embeddings_list = []
    pipeline = [
        {
            '$search': {
                "cosmosSearch": {
                    "vector": query_vector,
                    "numLists": 1,
                    "path": "contentVector",
                    "k": num_results
                },
                "returnStoredSource": True }},
        {'$project': { 'similarityScore': { '$meta': 'searchScore' }, 'document' : '$$ROOT' } }
    ]
    results = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
    return results
```

## 6.2 Perform vector search query

Finally, we execute our vector search function with a specific query and process the results to display them:

```python
query = "Shoes for Seattle sweater weather"
results = vector_search(query, 3)

print("\nResults:\n")
for result in results: 
    print(f"Similarity Score: {result['similarityScore']}")  
    print(f"Title: {result['document']['name']}")  
    print(f"Price: {result['document']['price']}")  
    print(f"Material: {result['document']['material']}") 
    print(f"Image: {result['document']['img_url']}") 
    print(f"Purchase: {result['document']['purchase_url']}\n")
```

## 7. Generating Ad content with GPT-4 and DALL.E

We combine all developed components to craft compelling ads, employing OpenAI's GPT-4 for text and DALL·E 3 for images. Together with vector search results, they form a complete ad. We also introduce Heelie, our intelligent assistant, tasked with creating engaging ad taglines. Through the upcoming code, you see Heelie in action, enhancing our ad creation process.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

def generate_ad_title(ad_topic):
    system_prompt = '''
    You are Heelie, an intelligent assistant for generating witty and cativating tagline for online advertisement.
        - The ad campaign taglines that you generate are short and typically under 100 characters.
    '''

    user_prompt = f'''Generate a catchy, witty, and short sentence (less than 100 characters) 
                    for an advertisement for selling shoes for {ad_topic}'''
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ]

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

def generate_ad_image(ad_topic):
    daliClient = OpenAI(
        api_key="<DALI_API_KEY>"
    )

    image_prompt = f'''
        Generate a photorealistic image of an ad campaign for selling {ad_topic}. 
        The image should be clean, with the item being sold in the foreground with an easily identifiable landmark of the city in the background.
        The image should also try to depict the weather of the location for the time of the year mentioned.
        The image should not have any generated text overlay.
    '''

    response = daliClient.images.generate(
        model="dall-e-3",
        prompt= image_prompt,
        size="1024x1024",
        quality="standard",
        n=1,
        )

    return response.data[0].url

def render_html_page(ad_topic):

    # Find the matching shoes from the inventory
    results = vector_search(ad_topic, 4)
    
    ad_header = generate_ad_title(ad_topic)
    ad_image_url = generate_ad_image(ad_topic)


    with open('./data/ad-start.html', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as html_file:
        html_content = html_file.read()

    html_content += f'''<header>
            <h1>{ad_header}</h1>
        </header>'''    

    html_content += f'''
            <section class="ad">
            <img src="{ad_image_url}" alt="Base Ad Image" class="ad-image">
        </section>'''

    for result in results: 
        html_content += f''' 
        <section class="product">
            <img src="{result['document']['img_url']}" alt="{result['document']['name']}" class="product-image">
            <div class="product-details">
                <h3 class="product-title" color="gray">{result['document']['name']}</h2>
                <p class="product-price">{"$"+str(result['document']['price'])}</p>
                <p class="product-description">{result['document']['description']}</p>
                <a href="{result['document']['purchase_url']}" class="buy-now-button">Buy Now</a>
            </div>
        </section>
        '''

    html_content += '''</article>
                    </body>
                    </html>'''

    return html_content
```

## 8. Putting it all together

To make our advertisement generation interactive, we employ Gradio, a Python library for creating simple web UIs. We define a UI that allows users to input ad topics and then dynamically generates and displays the resulting advertisement.

```python
import gradio as gr

css = """
    button { background-color: purple; color: red; }
    <style>
    </style>
"""

with gr.Blocks(css=css, theme=gr.themes.Default(spacing_size=gr.themes.sizes.spacing_sm, radius_size="none")) as demo:
    subject = gr.Textbox(placeholder="Ad Keywords", label="Prompt for Heelie!!")
    btn = gr.Button("Generate Ad")
    output_html = gr.HTML(label="Generated Ad HTML")

    btn.click(render_html_page, [subject], output_html)

    btn = gr.Button("Copy HTML")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch()   
```

  - ✅ NoSQL
# CustomerIntent: As a developer, I want to learn the basics of the .NET library so that I can build applications with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
---

# Quickstart: Use Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL with Azure SDK for .NET

[!INCLUDE[Developer Quickstart selector](includes/quickstart/dev-selector.md)]

In this quickstart, you deploy a basic Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL application using the Azure SDK for .NET. Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is a schemaless data store allowing applications to store unstructured data in the cloud. Query data in your containers and perform common operations on individual items using the Azure SDK for .NET.

[API reference documentation](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) | [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)

## Prerequisites

- Azure Developer CLI
- Docker Desktop
- .NET 9.0

If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Initialize the project

Use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to create an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account and deploy a containerized sample application. The sample application uses the client library to manage, create, read, and query sample data.

1. Open a terminal in an empty directory.

1. If you're not already authenticated, authenticate to the Azure Developer CLI using `azd auth login`. Follow the steps specified by the tool to authenticate to the CLI using your preferred Azure credentials.

    ```azurecli
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Use `azd init` to initialize the project.

    ```azurecli
    azd init --template cosmos-db-nosql-dotnet-quickstart
    ```

1. During initialization, configure a unique environment name.

1. Deploy the Azure Cosmos DB account using `azd up`. The Bicep templates also deploy a sample web application.

    ```azurecli
    azd up
    ```

1. During the provisioning process, select your subscription, desired location, and target resource group. Wait for the provisioning process to complete. The process can take **approximately five minutes**.

1. Once the provisioning of your Azure resources is done, a URL to the running web application is included in the output.

    ```output
    Deploying services (azd deploy)
    
      (✓) Done: Deploying service web
    - Endpoint: <https://[container-app-sub-domain].azurecontainerapps.io>
    
    SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned and deployed to Azure in 5 minutes 0 seconds.
    ```

1. Use the URL in the console to navigate to your web application in the browser. Observe the output of the running app.

:::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-dotnet/running-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the running web application.":::

### Install the client library

The client library is available through NuGet, as the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` package.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `/src/web` folder.

    ```bash
    cd ./src/web
    ```

1. If not already installed, install the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` package using `dotnet add package`.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.*
    ```

1. Also, install the `Azure.Identity` package if not already installed.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Azure.Identity --version 1.12.*
    ```

1. Open and review the **src/web/Cosmos.Samples.NoSQL.Quickstart.Web.csproj** file to validate that the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` and `Azure.Identity` entries both exist.

## Object model

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClient> | This class is the primary client class and is used to manage account-wide metadata or databases. |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Database> | This class represents a database within the account. |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container> | This class is primarily used to perform read, update, and delete operations on either the container or the items stored within the container. |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.PartitionKey> | This class represents a logical partition key. This class is required for many common operations and queries. |

## Code examples

- [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
- [Get a database](#get-a-database)
- [Get a container](#get-a-container)
- [Create an item](#create-an-item)
- [Get an item](#read-an-item)
- [Query items](#query-items)

The sample code in the template uses a database named `cosmicworks` and container named `products`. The `products` container contains details such as name, category, quantity, a unique identifier, and a sale flag for each product. The container uses the `/category` property as a logical partition key.

### Authenticate the client

This sample creates a new instance of the `CosmosClient` class and authenticates using a `DefaultAzureCredential` instance.

```csharp
DefaultAzureCredential credential = new();

CosmosClient client = new(
    accountEndpoint: "<azure-cosmos-db-nosql-account-endpoint>",
    tokenCredential: new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
```

### Get a database

Use `client.GetDatabase` to retrieve the existing database named *`cosmicworks`*.

```csharp
Database database = client.GetDatabase("cosmicworks");
```

### Get a container

Retrieve the existing *`products`* container using `database.GetContainer`.

```csharp
Container container = database.GetContainer("products");
```

### Create an item

Build a C# record type with all of the members you want to serialize into JSON. In this example, the type has a unique identifier, and fields for category, name, quantity, price, and sale.

```csharp
public record Product(
    string id,
    string category,
    string name,
    int quantity,
    decimal price,
    bool clearance
);
```

Create an item in the container using `container.UpsertItem`. This method "upserts" the item effectively replacing the item if it already exists.

```csharp
Product item = new(
    id: "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb",
    category: "gear-surf-surfboards",
    name: "Yamba Surfboard",
    quantity: 12,
    price: 850.00m,
    clearance: false
);

ItemResponse<Product> response = await container.UpsertItemAsync<Product>(
    item: item,
    partitionKey: new PartitionKey("gear-surf-surfboards")
);
```

### Read an item

Perform a point read operation by using both the unique identifier (`id`) and partition key fields. Use `container.ReadItem` to efficiently retrieve the specific item.

```csharp
ItemResponse<Product> response = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(
    id: "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb",
    partitionKey: new PartitionKey("gear-surf-surfboards")
);
```

### Query items

Perform a query over multiple items in a container using `container.GetItemQueryIterator`. Find all items within a specified category using this parameterized query:

```nosql
SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.category = @category
```

```csharp
string query = "SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.category = @category"

var query = new QueryDefinition(query)
  .WithParameter("@category", "gear-surf-surfboards");

using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Product>(
    queryDefinition: query
);
```

Parse the paginated results of the query by looping through each page of results using `feed.ReadNextAsync`. Use `feed.HasMoreResults` to determine if there are any results left at the start of each loop.

```csharp
List<Product> items = new();
while (feed.HasMoreResults)
{
    FeedResponse<Product> response = await feed.ReadNextAsync();
    foreach (Product item in response)
    {
        items.Add(item);
    }
}
```

### Explore your data

Use the Visual Studio Code extension for Azure Cosmos DB to explore your NoSQL data. You can perform core database operations including, but not limited to:

- Performing queries using a scrapbook or the query editor
- Modifying, updating, creating, and deleting items
- Importing bulk data from other sources
- Managing databases and containers

For more information, see [How-to use Visual Studio Code extension to explore Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL data](../visual-studio-code-extension.md?pivots=api-nosql).

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the sample application or resources, remove the corresponding deployment and all resources.

```azurecli
azd down
```

title: What's new in .NET Aspire 9.2
description: Learn what's new in the official general availability release of .NET Aspire 9.2.
ms.date: 04/10/2025
---

# What's new in .NET Aspire 9.2

📢 .NET Aspire 9.2 is the next minor version release of .NET Aspire; it supports:

- .NET 8.0 Long Term Support (LTS)
- .NET 9.0 Standard Term Support (STS)

If you have feedback, questions, or want to contribute to .NET Aspire, collaborate with us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/github-mark.svg" border="false"::: GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) or join us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/discord-icon.svg" border="false"::: Discord](https://discord.com/invite/h87kDAHQgJ) to chat with team members.

It's important to note that .NET Aspire releases out-of-band from .NET releases. While major versions of .NET Aspire align with .NET major versions, minor versions are released more frequently. For more information on .NET and .NET Aspire version support, see:

- [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy): Definitions for LTS and STS.
- [.NET Aspire support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspire): Important unique product life cycle details.

## ⬆️ Upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using `azd` to deploy Azure PostgreSQL or Azure SQL Server, you now have to configure Azure Managed Identities. For more information, see [🛡️ Improved Managed Identity defaults](#improved-managed-identity-defaults).

Moving between minor releases of .NET Aspire is simple:

1. In your app host project file (that is, _MyApp.AppHost.csproj_), update the [📦 Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) NuGet package to version `9.2.0`:

    ```diff
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

        <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.2.0" />
        
        <PropertyGroup>
            <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
            <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    -       <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
            <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
        </PropertyGroup>
        
        <ItemGroup>
            <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.2.0" />
        </ItemGroup>
    
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </Project>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The `IsAspireHost` property is no longer required in the project file. For more information, see [🚧 Project file changes](#project-file-changes).

    For more information, see [.NET Aspire SDK](xref:dotnet/aspire/sdk).

1. Check for any NuGet package updates, either using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the **Update NuGet Package** command in VS Code.
1. Update to the latest [.NET Aspire templates](../fundamentals/aspire-sdk-templates.md) by running the following .NET command line:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new update
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The `dotnet new update` command updates all of your templates to the latest version.

If your app host project file doesn't have the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` reference, you might still be using .NET Aspire 8. To upgrade to 9.0, follow [the upgrade guide](../get-started/upgrade-to-aspire-9.md).

## 🖥️ App host enhancements

The [app host](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md) is the core of .NET Aspire, providing the local hosting environment for your distributed applications. In .NET Aspire 9.2, we've made several improvements to the app host:

### 🚧 Project file changes

<span id="project-file-changes"></span>

The .NET Aspire app host project file no longer requires the `IsAspireHost` property. This property was moved to the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` SDK, therefore, you can remove it from your project file. For more information, see [dotnet/aspire issue #8144](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/8144).

### 🔗 Define custom resource URLs

Resources can now define custom URLs. This makes it easier to build custom experiences for your resources. For example, you can define a custom URL for a database resource that points to the database management console. This makes it easier to access the management console directly from the dashboard, you can even give it a friendly name.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalogDb = builder.AddPostgres("postgres")
                       .WithDataVolume()
                       .WithPgAdmin(resource =>
                       {
                           resource.WithUrlForEndpoint("http", u => u.DisplayText = "PG Admin");
                       })
                       .AddDatabase("catalogdb");
```

The preceding code sets the display text for the `PG Admin` URL to `PG Admin`. This makes it easier to access the management console directly from the dashboard.

For more information, see [Define custom resource URLs](../fundamentals/custom-resource-urls.md).

## 🔧 Dashboard user experience improvements

.NET Aspire 9.2 adds new features to the [dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md), making it a more powerful developer tool than ever. The following features were added to the dashboard in .NET Aspire 9.2:

### 🧩 Resource graph

The resource graph is a new way to visualize the resources in your apps. It displays a graph of resources, linked by relationships. Click the 'Graph' tab on the Resources page to view the resource graph. See it in action on [James's BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/james.newtonking.com/post/3lj7odu4re22p).

For more information, see [.NET Aspire dashboard: Resources page](../fundamentals/dashboard/explore.md#resources-page).

### 🎨 Resource icons

We've added resource icons to the resources page. The icon color matches the resource's telemetry in structured logs and traces.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-resource-icons.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-resource-icons.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard resource's page showing the new resource icons.":::

### ⏯️ Pause and resume telemetry

New buttons were added to the **Console logs**, **Structured logs**, **Traces** and **Metrics** pages to pause collecting telemetry. Click the pause button again to resume collecting telemetry.

This feature allows you to pause telemetry in the dashboard while continuing to interact with your app.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-pause-telemetry.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-pause-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dashboard showing the pause button.":::

### ❤️‍🩹 Metrics health warning

The dashboard now warns you when a metric exceeds the configured cardinality limit. Once exceeded, the metric no longer provides accurate information.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-cardinality-limit.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-cardinality-limit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a metric with the cardinality limit warning.":::

### 🕰️ UTC Console logs option

Console logs now supports UTC timestamps. The setting is accessible via the console logs options button.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-console-logs-utc.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-console-logs-utc.png" alt-text="Screenshot of console logs page showing the UTC timestamps option.":::

### 🔎 Trace details search text box

We've added a search text box to trace details. Now you can quickly filter large traces to find the exact span you need. See it in action on [BluSky](https://bsky.app/profile/james.newtonking.com/post/3llunn7fc4s2p).

### 🌐 HTTP-based resource command functionality

[Custom resource commands](../fundamentals/custom-resource-commands.md) now support HTTP-based functionality with the addition of the `WithHttpCommand` API, enabling you to define endpoints for tasks like database migrations or resets. These commands can be run directly from the .NET Aspire dashboard.

Adds WithHttpCommand(), which lets you define a resource command that sends an HTTP request to your app during development. Useful for triggering endpoints like seed or reset from the dashboard.

```csharp
if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    var resetDbKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    catalogDbApp.WithEnvironment("DatabaseResetKey", resetDbKey)
                .WithHttpCommand("/reset-db", "Reset Database",
                    commandOptions: new()
                    {
                        Description = "Reset the catalog database to its initial state. This will delete and recreate the database.",
                        ConfirmationMessage = "Are you sure you want to reset the catalog database?",
                        IconName = "DatabaseLightning",
                        PrepareRequest = requestContext =>
                        {
                            requestContext.Request.Headers.Add("Authorization", $"Key {resetDbKey}");
                            return Task.CompletedTask;
                        }
                    });
}
```

For more information, see [Custom HTTP commands in .NET Aspire](../fundamentals/http-commands.md).

### 🗂️ Connection string resource type

We've introduced a new `ConnectionStringResource` type that makes it easier to build dynamic connection strings without defining a separate resource type. This makes it easier to work with and build dynamic parameterized connection strings.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiKey = builder.AddParameter("apiKey");
var cs = builder.AddConnectionString("openai", 
    ReferenceExpression.Create($"Endpoint=https://api.openai.com/v1;AccessKey={apiKey};"));

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
                .WithReference(cs);
```

### 📥 Container resources can now specify an image pull policy

Container resources can now specify an `ImagePullPolicy` to control when the image is pulled. This is useful for resources that are updated frequently or that have a large image size. The following policies are supported:

- `Default`: Default behavior (which is the same as `Missing` in 9.2).
- `Always`: Always pull the image.
- `Missing`: Ensures the image is always pulled when the container starts.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache")
                   .WithImageTag("latest")
                   .WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.Always)
                   .WithRedisInsight();
```

The `ImagePullPolicy` is set to `Always`, which means the image will always be pulled when the resource is created. This is useful for resources that are updated frequently.

### 📂 New container files API

In .NET Aspire 9.2, we've added a new `WithContainerFiles` API, a way to create files and folders inside a container at runtime by defining them in code. Under the hood, it uses `docker cp` / `podman cp` to copy the files in. Supports setting contents, permissions, and ownership—no bind mounts or temp files needed.

## 🤝 Integrations updates

Integrations are a key part of .NET Aspire, allowing you to easily add and configure services in your app. In .NET Aspire 9.2, we've made several updates to integrations:

### 🔐 Redis/Valkey/Garnet: Password support enabled by default

The Redis, Valkey, and Garnet containers enable password authentication by default. This is part of our goal to be secure by default—protecting development environments with sensible defaults while still making them easy to configure. Passwords can be set explicitly or generated automatically if not provided.

### 💾 Automatic database creation support

There's [plenty of feedback and confusion](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/7101) around the `AddDatabase` API. The name implies that it adds a database, but it didn't actually create the database. In .NET Aspire 9.2, the `AddDatabase` API now creates a database for the following hosting integrations:

| Hosting integration | API reference |
|--|--|
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer) | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.SqlServerBuilderExtensions.AddDatabase*> |
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSql) | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.PostgresBuilderExtensions.AddDatabase*> |

The Azure SQL and Azure PostgreSQL hosting integrations also expose `AddDatabase` APIs which work with their respective `RunAsContainer` methods. For more information, see [Understand Azure integration APIs](../azure/integrations-overview.md#understand-azure-integration-apis).

By default, .NET Aspire will create an empty database if it doesn't exist. You can also optionally provide a custom script to run during creation for advanced setup or seeding.

Example using Postgres:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("pg1");

postgres.AddDatabase("todoapp")
    .WithCreationScript($$"""
        CREATE DATABASE {{databaseName}}
            ENCODING = 'UTF8';
        """);
```

For more information and examples of using the `AddDatabase` API, see:

- [Add PostgreSQL resource with database scripts](../database/postgresql-integration.md#add-postgresql-resource-with-database-scripts)
- [Add SQL Server resource with database scripts](../database/sql-server-integration.md#add-sql-server-resource-with-database-scripts)

The following hosting integrations don't currently support database creation:

- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.MongoDb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.MongoDb)
- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.MySql)
- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Oracle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Oracle)

## ☁️ Azure integration updates

In .NET Aspire 9.2, we've made significant updates to Azure integrations, including:

### ⚙️ Configure Azure Container Apps environments

.NET Aspire 9.2 introduces `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment`, allowing you to define an Azure Container App environment directly in your app model. This adds an `AzureContainerAppsEnvironmentResource` that lets you configure the environment and its supporting infrastructure (like container registries and volume file shares) using C# and the <xref:Azure.Provisioning> APIs—without relying on `azd` for infrastructure generation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This uses a different resource naming scheme than `azd`. If you're upgrading an existing deployment, this may create duplicate resources. To avoid this, you can opt into `azd`'s naming convention:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("my-env")
       .WithAzdResourceNaming();
```

For more information, see [Configure Azure Container Apps environments](../azure/configure-aca-environments.md).

### 🆕 New Client integrations: Azure PostgreSQL (Npgsql & EF Core)

.NET Aspire 9.2 adds client integrations for working with **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**, supporting both local development and secure cloud deployment.

These integrations automatically use **Managed Identity (Entra ID)** in the cloud and during local development by default. They also support username/password, if configured in your AppHost. No application code changes are required to switch between authentication models.

- [📦 Aspire.Azure.Npgsql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Npgsql)
- [📦 Aspire.Azure.Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL)

**In AppHost:**

```csharp
var postgres = builder.AddAzurePostgresFlexibleServer("pg")
                      .AddDatabase("postgresdb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.MyService>()
       .WithReference(postgres);
```

**In MyService:**

```csharp
builder.AddAzureNpgsqlDbContext<MyDbContext>("postgresdb");
```

### 🖇️ Resource Deep Linking for Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, Service Bus, and OpenAI

CosmosDB databases and containers, EventHub hubs, ServiceBus queues/topics, and Azure OpenAI deployments now support **resource deep linking**. This allows connection information to target specific child resources—like a particular **Cosmos DB container**, **Event Hubs**, or **OpenAI deployment**—rather than just the top-level account or namespace.

Hosting integrations preserve the full resource hierarchy in connection strings, and client integrations can resolve and inject clients scoped to those specific resources.

**AppHost:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cosmos = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmos")
                    .RunAsPreviewEmulator(e => e.WithDataExplorer());

var db = cosmos.AddCosmosDatabase("appdb");
db.AddContainer("todos", partitionKey: "/userId");
db.AddContainer("users", partitionKey: "/id");

builder.AddProject<Projects.TodoApi>("api")
       .WithReference(db);
```

**In the API project:**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureCosmosDatabase("appdb")
       .AddKeyedContainer("todos")
       .AddKeyedContainer("users");

app.MapPost("/todos", async ([FromKeyedServices("todos")] Container container, TodoItem todo) =>
{
    todo.Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    await container.CreateItemAsync(todo, new PartitionKey(todo.UserId));
    return Results.Created($"/todos/{todo.Id}", todo);
});
```

This makes it easy and convenient to use the SDKs to interact with specific resources directly—without extra wiring or manual configuration. It's especially useful in apps that deal with multiple containers or Azure services.

### 🛡️ Improved Managed Identity defaults

<span id="improved-managed-identity-defaults"></span>

Starting in **.NET Aspire 9.2**, each Azure Container App now gets its **own dedicated managed identity** by default. This is a significant change from previous versions, where all apps shared a single, highly privileged identity.

This change strengthens Aspire's *secure by default* posture:

- Each app only gets access to the Azure resources it needs.
- It enforces the principle of least privilege.
- It provides better isolation between apps in multi-service environments.

By assigning identities individually, Aspire can now scope role assignments more precisely—improving security, auditability, and alignment with Azure best practices.

This is a **behavioral breaking change** and may impact apps using:

- **Azure SQL Server** - Azure SQL only supports one Azure AD admin. With multiple identities, only the *last deployed app* will be granted admin access by default. Other apps will need explicit users and role assignments.

- **Azure PostgreSQL** - The app that creates the database becomes the owner. Other apps (like those running migrations or performing data operations) will need explicit `GRANT` permissions to access the database correctly.

See the [breaking changes](../compatibility/9.2/index.md) page for more details.

This new identity model is an important step toward more secure and maintainable applications in Aspire. While it introduces some setup considerations, especially for database integrations, it lays the groundwork for better default security across the board.

### 🔑 Least-privilege role assignment functionality

.NET Aspire now supports APIs for modeling **least-privilege role assignments** when deploying to. This enables more secure defaults by allowing you to define exactly which roles each app needs for specific Azure resources.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
                     .RunAsEmulator(c => c.WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent));

var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AzureContainerApps_ApiService>("api")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .WithReference(blobs)
       .WithRoleAssignments(storage, StorageBuiltInRole.StorageBlobDataContributor);
```

In this example, the API project is granted **Storage Blob Data Contributor** only for the referenced storage account. This avoids over-provisioning permissions and helps enforce the principle of least privilege.

Each container app automatically gets its own **managed identity**, and Aspire now generates the necessary role assignment infrastructure for both default and per-reference roles. When targeting existing Azure resources, role assignments are scoped correctly using separate Bicep resources.

### 1️⃣ First-class Azure Key Vault Secret support

Aspire now supports `IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference`, a new primitive for modeling secrets directly in the app model. This replaces `BicepSecretOutputReference` and avoids creating a separate Key Vault per resource.

You can now:

- Add a shared Key Vault in C#
- Configure services that support keys (e.g., Redis, Cosmos DB) to store their secrets there
- Reference those secrets in your app as environment variables or via the Key Vault config provider

Use KeyVault directly in your api:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var vault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("kv");

var redis = builder.AddAzureRedis("redis")
                   .WithAccessKeyAuthentication(vault);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithReference(redis);
```

Let the compute environment handle the secret management for you:

```csharp
var redis = builder.AddAzureRedis("redis")
                   .WithAccessKeyAuthentication();

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithReference(redis);
```

**Previous behavior:**

  `azd` created and managed secrets using a key vault per resource, with no visibility in the app model. Secrets were handled implicitly and couldn't be customized in C#.

**New behavior in 9.2:**

  Calling `WithKeyAccessAuthentication` or `WithPasswordAuthentication` now creates an actual `AzureKeyVaultResource` (or accepts a reference to one), and stores connection strings there. Secret names follow the pattern `connectionstrings--{resourcename}` to prevent naming conflicts with other vault entries.

### 🔒 Improved default permissions for Azure Key Vault references

When referencing a Key Vault, Aspire previously granted the broad **Key Vault Administrator** role by default. In 9.2, this has been changed to **Key Vault Secrets User**, which provides read-only access to secrets—suitable for most application scenarios.

This update continues the security-focused improvements in this release.

## 🚀 Deployment improvements

We're excited to announce several new deployment features in .NET Aspire 9.2, including:

### 📦 Publishers (Preview)

Publishers are a new extensibility point in .NET Aspire that allow you to define how your distributed application gets transformed into deployable assets. Rather than relying on an [intermediate manifest format](../deployment/manifest-format.md), publishers can now plug directly into the application model to generate Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, Azure resources, or whatever else your environment needs.

When .NET Aspire launched, it introduced a deployment manifest format—a serialized snapshot of the application model. While useful it burdened deployment tools with interpreting the manifest and resource authors with ensuring accurate serialization. This approach also complicated schema evolution and target-specific behaviors.

Publishers simplify this process by working directly with the full application model in-process, enabling richer, more flexible, and maintainable publishing experiences.

The following NuGet packages expose preview publishers:

- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure)
- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Docker (Preview)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker)
- [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes (Preview)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Docker and Kubernetes publishers were contributed by community contributor, [Dave Sekula](https://github.com/Prom3theu5)—a great example of the community stepping up to extend the model. 💜 Thank you, Dave!

To use a publisher, add the corresponding NuGet package to your app host project file and then call the `Add[Name]Publisher()` method in your app host builder.

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposePublisher();
```

> [!TIP]
> Publisher registration methods follow the `Add[Name]Publisher()` convention.

You can also build your own publisher by implementing the publishing APIs and calling your custom registration method. Some publishers are still in preview, and the APIs are subject to change. The goal is to provide a more flexible and extensible way to publish distributed applications, making it easier to adapt to different deployment environments and scenarios.

### 🆕 Aspire CLI (Preview)

.NET Aspire 9.2 introduces the new **`aspire` CLI**, a tool for creating, running, and publishing Aspire applications from the command line. It provides a rich, interactive experience tailored for Aspire users.

The CLI is available as a .NET tool and can be installed with:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global aspire.cli --prerelease
```

#### Example usage:

```bash
aspire new
aspire run
aspire add redis
aspire publish --publisher docker-compose
```

#### Available commands:

- `new <template>` – Create a new Aspire sample project  
- `run` – Run an Aspire app host in development mode  
- `add <integration>` – Add an integration to your project  
- `publish` – Generate deployment artifacts from your app host

🧪 The CLI is **preview**. We're exploring how to make it a first-class experience for .NET Aspire users—your feedback is welcome!

## 🧪 Testing template updates

The xUnit testing project template now supports a version selector, allowing the user to select either:

- `v2`: The previous xUnit testing experience.
- `v3`: The new xUnit testing experience and template.
- `v3 with Microsoft Test Platform`: The next xUnit testing experience, template and uses the [Microsoft Testing Platform](/dotnet/core/testing/microsoft-testing-platform-intro).

By default, to the `v3` experience. For more information, see:

- [What's new in xUnit v.3](https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/whats-new)
- [Microsoft Testing Platform support in xUnit.net v3](https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/microsoft-testing-platform)

> [!NOTE]
> Both `v3` versions are only supported with .NET Aspire 9.2 or later.

## 💔 Breaking changes

With every release, we strive to make .NET Aspire better. However, some changes may break existing functionality. The following breaking changes are introduced in .NET Aspire 9.2:

# .NET Aspire overview

:::row:::
:::column:::

:::image type="icon" border="false" source="../../assets/dotnet-aspire-logo-128.svg":::

:::column-end:::
:::column span="3":::

.NET Aspire is a set of tools, templates, and packages for building observable, production ready apps.​​ .NET Aspire is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that bootstrap or improve specific challenges with modern app development. Today's apps generally consume a large number of services, such as databases, messaging, and caching, many of which are supported via [.NET Aspire Integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md). For information on support, see the [.NET Aspire Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspire).

:::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Why .NET Aspire?

.NET Aspire improves the experience of building apps that have a variety of projects and resources. With dev-time productivity enhancements that emulate deployed scenarios, you can quickly develop interconnected apps. Designed for flexibility, .NET Aspire allows you to replace or extend parts with your preferred tools and workflows. Key features include:

- [**Dev-Time Orchestration**](#dev-time-orchestration): .NET Aspire provides features for running and connecting multi-project applications, container resources, and other dependencies for [local development environments](../fundamentals/networking-overview.md).
- [**Integrations**](#net-aspire-integrations): .NET Aspire integrations are NuGet packages for commonly used services, such as Redis or Postgres, with standardized interfaces ensuring they connect consistently and seamlessly with your app.
- [**Tooling**](#project-templates-and-tooling): .NET Aspire comes with project templates and tooling experiences for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/) to help you create and interact with .NET Aspire projects.

## Dev-time orchestration

In .NET Aspire, "orchestration" primarily focuses on enhancing the _local development_ experience by simplifying the management of your app's configuration and interconnections. It's important to note that .NET Aspire's orchestration isn't intended to replace the robust systems used in production environments, such as [Kubernetes](../deployment/overview.md#deploy-to-kubernetes). Instead, it's a set of abstractions that streamline the setup of service discovery, environment variables, and container configurations, eliminating the need to deal with low-level implementation details. With .NET Aspire, your code has a consistent bootstrapping experience on any dev machine without the need for complex manual steps, making it easier to manage during the development phase.

.NET Aspire orchestration assists with the following concerns:

- **App composition**: Specify the .NET projects, containers, executables, and cloud resources that make up the application.
- **Service discovery and connection string management**: The app host injects the right connection strings, network configurations, and service discovery information to simplify the developer experience.

For example, using .NET Aspire, the following code creates a local Redis container resource, waits for it to become available, and then configures the appropriate connection string in the `"frontend"` project with a few helper method calls:

```csharp
// Create a distributed application builder given the command line arguments.
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add a Redis server to the application.
var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

// Add the frontend project to the application and configure it to use the 
// Redis server, defined as a referenced dependency.
builder.AddProject<Projects.MyFrontend>("frontend")
       .WithReference(cache)
       .WaitFor(cache);
```

For more information, see [.NET Aspire orchestration overview](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The call to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedis*> creates a new Redis container in your local dev environment. If you'd rather use an existing Redis instance, you can use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> method to reference an existing connection string. For more information, see [Reference existing resources](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#reference-existing-resources).

## .NET Aspire integrations

[.NET Aspire integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md) are NuGet packages designed to simplify connections to popular services and platforms, such as Redis or PostgreSQL. .NET Aspire integrations handle cloud resource setup and interaction for you through standardized patterns, such as adding health checks and telemetry. Integrations are two-fold - ["hosting" integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md#hosting-integrations) represents the service you're connecting to, and ["client" integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md#client-integrations) represents the client or consumer of that service. In other words, for many hosting packages there's a corresponding client package that handles the service connection within your code.

Each integration is designed to work with the .NET Aspire app host, and their configurations are injected automatically by [referencing named resources](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#reference-resources). In other words, if _Example.ServiceFoo_ references _Example.ServiceBar_, _Example.ServiceFoo_ inherits the integration's required configurations to allow them to communicate with each other automatically.

For example, consider the following code using the .NET Aspire Service Bus integration:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient("servicebus");
```

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireServiceBusExtensions.AddAzureServiceBusClient%2A> method handles the following concerns:

- Registers a <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClient> as a singleton in the DI container for connecting to Azure Service Bus.
- Applies <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClient> configurations either inline through code or through configuration.
- Enables corresponding health checks, logging, and telemetry specific to the Azure Service Bus usage.

A full list of available integrations is detailed on the [.NET Aspire integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md) overview page.

## Project templates and tooling

.NET Aspire provides a set of project templates and tooling experiences for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/). These templates are designed to help you create and interact with .NET Aspire projects, or add .NET Aspire into your existing codebase. The templates include a set of opinionated defaults to help you get started quickly - for example, it has boilerplate code for turning on health checks and logging in .NET apps. These defaults are fully customizable, so you can edit and adapt them to suit your needs.

.NET Aspire templates also include boilerplate extension methods that handle common service configurations for you:

```csharp
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
```

For more information on what `AddServiceDefaults` does, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](../fundamentals/service-defaults.md).

When added to your _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file, the preceding code handles the following concerns:

- **OpenTelemetry**: Sets up formatted logging, runtime metrics, built-in meters, and tracing for ASP.NET Core, gRPC, and HTTP. For more information, see [.NET Aspire telemetry](../fundamentals/telemetry.md).
- **Default health checks**: Adds default health check endpoints that tools can query to monitor your app. For more information, see [.NET app health checks in C#](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/diagnostic-health-checks).
- **Service discovery**: Enables [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) for the app and configures <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> accordingly.

# What's new in .NET Aspire 9.1

📢 .NET Aspire 9.1 is the next minor version release of .NET Aspire; it supports _both_:

- .NET 8.0 Long Term Support (LTS) _or_
- .NET 9.0 Standard Term Support (STS).

> [!NOTE]
> You're able to use .NET Aspire 9.1 with either .NET 8 or .NET 9!

As always, we focused on highly requested features and pain points from the community. Our theme for 9.1 was "polish, polish, polish"—so you see quality of life fixes throughout the whole platform. Some highlights from this release are resource relationships in the dashboard, support for working in GitHub Codespaces, and publishing resources as a Dockerfile.

If you have feedback, questions, or want to contribute to .NET Aspire, collaborate with us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/github-mark.svg" border="false"::: GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) or join us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/discord-icon.svg" border="false"::: Discord](https://discord.com/invite/h87kDAHQgJ) to chat with team members.

Whether you're new to .NET Aspire or have been with us since the preview, it's important to note that .NET Aspire releases out-of-band from .NET releases. While major versions of .NET Aspire align with .NET major versions, minor versions are released more frequently. For more details on .NET and .NET Aspire version support, see:

- [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy): Definitions for LTS and STS.
- [.NET Aspire support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspire): Important unique product life cycle details.

## ⬆️ Upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.1

Moving between minor releases of .NET Aspire is simple:

1. In your app host project file (that is, _MyApp.AppHost.csproj_), update the [📦 Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) NuGet package to version `9.1.0`:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

        <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.1.0" />
        
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    
    </Project>
    ```

    For more information, see [.NET Aspire SDK](xref:dotnet/aspire/sdk).

1. Check for any NuGet package updates, either using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the **Update NuGet Package** command in VS Code.
1. Update to the latest [.NET Aspire templates](../fundamentals/aspire-sdk-templates.md) by running the following .NET command line:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new update
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `dotnet new update` command updates all of your templates to the latest version.

If your app host project file doesn't have the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` reference, you might still be using .NET Aspire 8. To upgrade to 9.0, you can follow [the documentation from last release](../get-started/upgrade-to-aspire-9.md).

## 🌱 Improved onboarding experience

The onboarding experience for .NET Aspire is improved with 9.1. The team worked on creating a GitHub Codespaces template that installs all the necessary dependencies for .NET Aspire, making it easier to get started, including the templates and the ASP.NET Core developer certificate. Additionally, there's support for Dev Containers. For more information, see:

- [.NET Aspire and GitHub Codespaces](../get-started/github-codespaces.md)
- [.NET Aspire and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](../get-started/dev-containers.md)

## 🔧 Dashboard UX and customization

With every release of .NET Aspire, the [dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) gets more powerful and customizable, this release is no exception. The following features were added to the dashboard in .NET Aspire 9.1:

### 🧩 Resource relationships

The dashboard now supports "parent" and "child" resource relationships. For instance, when you create a Postgres instance with multiple databases, these databases are nested under the same instance on the **Resource** page.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-parentchild.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-parentchild.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing the Postgres resource with a database nested underneath it.":::

For more information, see [Explore the .NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/explore.md).

### 🔤 Localization overrides

The dashboard defaults to the language set in your browser. This release introduces the ability to override this setting and change the dashboard language independently from the browser language. Consider the following screen capture that demonstrates the addition of the language dropdown in the dashboard:

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-language.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-language.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing the new flyout menu to change language.":::

### 🗑️ Clear logs and telemetry from the dashboard

New buttons were added to the **Console logs**, **Structured logs**, **Traces** and **Metrics** pages to clear data. There's also a "Remove all" button in the settings popup to remove everything with one action.

Now you use this feature to reset the dashboard to a blank slate, test your app, view only the relevant logs and telemetry, and repeat.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-remove-telemetry.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-remove-telemetry.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing the remove button on the structured logs page.":::

We 💜 love the developer community and thrive on its feedback, collaboration, and contributions. This feature is a community contribution from [@Daluur](https://github.com/Daluur). Join us in celebrating their contribution by using the feature!

> [!TIP]
> If you're interested in contributing to .NET Aspire, look for issues labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) and follow the [contributor guide](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/docs/contributing.md).

### 🔢 New filtering

You can now filter what you see in the **Resource** page by **Resource type**, **State**, and **Health state**. Consider the following screen capture, which demonstrates the addition of the filter options in the dashboard:

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-filter.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-filter.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing the new filter options.":::

### 📝 More resource details

When you select a resource in the dashboard, the details pane now displays new data points, including **References**, **Back references**, and **Volumes** with their mount types. This enhancement provides a clearer and more comprehensive view of your resources, improving the overall user experience by making relevant details more accessible.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-resourcedetails.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-resourcedetails.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard with references and back references showing.":::

For more information, see [.NET Aspire dashboard: Resources page](../fundamentals/dashboard/explore.md#resources-page).

### 🛡️ CORS support for custom local domains

You can now set the `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to allow the dashboard to receive telemetry from other browser apps, such as if you have resources running on custom localhost domains.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire app host: Dashboard configuration](../app-host/configuration.md#dashboard).

### 🪵 Flexibility with console logs

The console log page has two new options. You're now able to download your logs so you can view them in your own diagnostics tools. Plus, you can turn timestamps on or off to reduce visual clutter when needed.

:::image type="content" source="media/consolelogs-download.png" lightbox="media/consolelogs-download.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the console logs page with the download button, turn off timestamps button, and logs that don't show timestamps.":::

For more information, see [.NET Aspire dashboard: Console logs page](../fundamentals/dashboard/explore.md#console-logs-page).

### 🎨 Various UX improvements

Several new features in .NET Aspire 9.1 enhance and streamline the following popular tasks:

- ▶️ Resource commands, such as **Start** and **Stop** buttons, are now available on the **Console logs** page.
- 🔍 Single selection to open in the _text visualizer_.
- 🔗 URLs within logs are now automatically clickable, with commas removed from endpoints.

Additionally, the 🖱️ scroll position resets when switching between different resources—this helps to visually reset the current resource view.  

For more details on the latest dashboard enhancements, check out [James Newton-King on :::image type="icon" source="../media/bluesky-icon.svg" border="false"::: Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/james.newtonking.com), where he's been sharing new features daily.

## ⚙️ Local development enhancements

In .NET Aspire 9.1, several improvements to streamline your local development experience were an emphasis. These enhancements are designed to provide greater flexibility, better integration with Docker, and more efficient resource management. Here are some of the key updates:

### ▶️ Start resources on demand

You can now tell resources not to start with the rest of your app by using <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExplicitStart*> on the resource in your app host. Then, you can start it whenever you're ready from inside the dashboard.

For more information, see [Configure explicit resource start](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#configure-explicit-resource-start).

### 🐳 Better Docker integration

The `PublishAsDockerfile()` feature was introduced for all projects and executable resources. This enhancement allows for complete customization of the Docker container and Dockerfile used during the publish process.

While this API was available in previous versions, it couldn't be used with <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ProjectResource> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ExecutableResource> types.

### 🧹 Cleaning up Docker networks

In 9.1, we addressed a persistent issue where Docker networks created by .NET Aspire would remain active even after the application was stopped. This bug, tracked in [.NET Aspire GitHub issue #6504](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6504), is resolved. Now, Docker networks are properly cleaned up, ensuring a more efficient and tidy development environment.

### ✅ Socket address issues fixed

Several users reported issues ([#6693](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6693), [#6704](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6704), [#7095](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/7095)) with restarting the .NET Aspire app host, including reconciliation errors and "address already in use" messages.

This release introduces a more robust approach to managing socket addresses, ensuring only one instance of each address is used at a time. Additionally, improvements were made to ensure proper project restarts and resource releases, preventing hanging issues. These changes enhance the stability and reliability of the app host, especially during development and testing.

## 🔌 Integration updates

.NET Aspire continues to excel through its [integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md) with various platforms. This release includes numerous updates to existing integrations and details about ownership migrations, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience.

### ☁️ Azure updates

This release also focused on improving various [Azure integrations](../azure/integrations-overview.md):

#### 🆕 New emulators

We're excited to bring new emulators for making local development easier. The following integrations got new emulators in this release:

- [Azure Service Bus](../messaging/azure-service-bus-integration.md#add-azure-service-bus-emulator-resource)
- [Azure Cosmos DB Linux-based (preview)](../database/azure-cosmos-db-integration.md#use-linux-based-emulator-preview)
- [Azure SignalR](/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-howto-emulator)

```csharp
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("servicebus")
                        .RunAsEmulator();

#pragma warning disable ASPIRECOSMOSDB001
var cosmosDb = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmosdb")
                      .RunAsPreviewEmulator();

var signalr = builder.AddAzureSignalR("signalr", AzureSignalRServiceMode.Serverless)
                     .RunAsEmulator();
```

These new emulators work side-by-side with the existing emulators for:

- [Azure Storage](../storage/azure-storage-integrations.md)
- [Azure Event Hubs](../messaging/azure-event-hubs-integration.md#add-azure-event-hubs-emulator-resource)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](../database/azure-cosmos-db-integration.md#add-azure-cosmos-db-emulator-resource)

#### 🌌 Cosmos DB

Along with support for the new emulator, Cosmos DB added the following features.

##### 🔒 Support for Entra ID authentication by default

Previously, the Cosmos DB integration used access keys and a Key Vault secret to connect to the service. .NET Aspire 9.1 added support for using more secure authentication using managed identities by default. If you need to keep using access key authentication, you can get back to the previous behavior by calling <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosExtensions.WithAccessKeyAuthentication*>.

##### 💽 Support for modeling Database and Containers in the app host

You can define a Cosmos DB database and containers in the app host and these resources are available when you run the application in both the emulator and in Azure. This allows you to define these resources up front and no longer need to create them from the application, which might not have permission to create them.

For example API usage to add database and containers, see the following related articles:

- [.NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration](../database/azure-cosmos-db-integration.md#add-azure-cosmos-db-database-and-container-resources)
- [.NET Aspire Cosmos DB Entity Framework Core integration](../database/azure-cosmos-db-entity-framework-integration.md#add-azure-cosmos-db-database-and-container-resources)

##### ⚡ Support for Cosmos DB-based triggers in Azure Functions

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosDBResource> was modified to support consumption in Azure Functions applications that uses the Cosmos DB trigger. A Cosmos DB resource can be initialized and added as a reference to an Azure Functions resource with the following code:

```csharp
var cosmosDb = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmosdb")
                      .RunAsEmulator();
var database = cosmosDb.AddCosmosDatabase("mydatabase");
database.AddContainer("mycontainer", "/id");

var funcApp = builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.AzureFunctionsEndToEnd_Functions>("funcapp")
    .WithReference(cosmosDb)
    .WaitFor(cosmosDb);
```

The resource can be used in the Azure Functions trigger as follows:

```csharp
public class MyCosmosDbTrigger(ILogger<MyCosmosDbTrigger> logger)
{
    [Function(nameof(MyCosmosDbTrigger))]
    public void Run([CosmosDBTrigger(
        databaseName: "mydatabase",
        containerName: "mycontainer",
        CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true,
        Connection = "cosmosdb")] IReadOnlyList<Document> input)
    {
        logger.LogInformation(
            "C# cosmosdb trigger function processed: {Count} messages",
            input.Count);
    }
}
```

For more information using Azure Functions with .NET Aspire, see [.NET Aspire Azure Functions integration (Preview)](../serverless/functions.md).

#### 🚚 Service Bus and Event Hubs

Similar to Cosmos DB, the Service Bus and Event Hubs integrations now allow you to define Azure Service Bus queues, topics, subscriptions, and Azure Event Hubs instances and consumer groups directly in your app host code. This enhancement simplifies your application logic by enabling the creation and management of these resources outside the application itself.

For more information, see the following updated articles:

- [.NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration](../messaging/azure-service-bus-integration.md)
- [.NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration](../messaging/azure-event-hubs-integration.md)

#### ♻️ Working with existing resources

There's consistent feedback about making it easier to connect to existing Azure resources in .NET Aspire. With 9.1, you can now easily connect to an existing Azure resource either directly by `string` name, or with [app model parameters](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md) which can be changed at deployment time. For example to connect to an Azure Service Bus account, we can use the following code:

```csharp
var existingServiceBusName = builder.AddParameter("serviceBusName");
var existingServiceBusResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("serviceBusResourceGroup");

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging")
                        .AsExisting(existingServiceBusName, existingServiceBusResourceGroup);
```

The preceding code reads the name and resource group from the parameters, and connects to the existing resource when the application is run or deployed. For more information, see [use existing Azure resources](../azure/integrations-overview.md#use-existing-azure-resources).

#### 🌍 Azure Container Apps

Experimental support for configuring custom domains in Azure Container Apps (ACA) was added. For example:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable ASPIREACADOMAINS001

var customDomain = builder.AddParameter("customDomain");
var certificateName = builder.AddParameter("certificateName");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AzureContainerApps_ApiService>("api")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .PublishAsAzureContainerApp((infra, app) =>
       {
           app.ConfigureCustomDomain(customDomain, certificateName);
       });
```

For more information, see [.NET Aspire diagnostics overview](../diagnostics/overview.md).

### ➕ Even more integration updates

- OpenAI now supports the [📦 Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.AI) NuGet package.
- RabbitMQ updated to version 7, and MongoDB to version 3. These updates introduced breaking changes, leading to the release of new packages with version-specific suffixes. The original packages continue to use the previous versions, while the new packages are as follows:
  - [📦 Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7) NuGet package. For more information, see the [.NET Aspire RabbitMQ client integration](../messaging/rabbitmq-integration.md#client-integration) documentation.
  - [📦 Aspire.MongoDB.Driver.v3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.MongoDB.Driver.v3) NuGet package. For more information, see the [.NET Aspire MongoDB client integration](../database/mongodb-integration.md#client-integration) documentation.
- Dapr migrated to the [CommunityToolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/tree/main/src/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Dapr) to facilitate faster innovation.
- Numerous other integrations received updates, fixes, and new features. For detailed information, refer to our [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/releases).

The [📦 Aspire.Hosting.AWS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AWS) NuGet package and source code migrated under [Amazon Web Services (AWS)) ownership](https://github.com/aws/integrations-on-dotnet-aspire-for-aws). This migration happened as part of .NET Aspire 9.0, we're just restating that change here.

## 🧪 Testing in .NET Aspire

.NET Aspire 9.1 simplifies writing cross-functional integration tests with a robust approach. The app host allows you to create, evaluate, and manage containerized environments seamlessly within a test run. This functionality supports popular testing frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest, enhancing your testing capabilities and efficiency.

Now, you're able to disable port randomization or enable the [dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md). For more information, see [.NET Aspire testing overview](../testing/overview.md). Additionally, you can now [Pass arguments to your app host](../testing/manage-app-host.md#pass-arguments-to-your-app-host).

Some of these enhancements were introduced as a result of stability issues that were reported, such as [.NET Aspire GitHub issue #6678](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6678)—where some resources failed to start do to "address in use" errors.

## 🚀 Deployment

Significant improvements to the Azure Container Apps (ACA) deployment process are included in .NET Aspire 9.1, enhancing both the `azd` CLI and app host options. One of the most requested features—support for deploying `npm` applications to ACA—is now implemented. This new capability allows `npm` apps to be deployed to ACA just like other resources, streamlining the deployment process and providing greater flexibility for developers.

We recognize there's more work to be done in the area of deployment. Future releases will continue to address these opportunities for improvement. For more information on deploying .NET Aspire to ACA, see [Deploy a .NET Aspire project to Azure Container Apps](../deployment/azure/aca-deployment.md).

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

.NET Aspire is moving quickly, and with that comes breaking changes. Breaking are categorized as either:

- **Binary incompatible**: The assembly version has changed, and you need to recompile your code.
- **Source incompatible**: The source code has changed, and you need to change your code.
- **Behavioral change**: The code behaves differently, and you need to change your code.

Typically APIs are decorated with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> giving you a warning when you compile, and an opportunity to adjust your code. For an overview of breaking changes in .NET Aspire 9.1, see [Breaking changes in .NET Aspire 9.1](../compatibility/9.1/index.md).

## 🎯 Upgrade today

Follow the directions outlined in the [Upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.1](#-upgrade-to-net-aspire-91) section to make the switch to 9.1 and take advantage of all these new features today! As always, we're listening for your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues)-and looking out for what you want to see in 9.2 ☺️.

For a complete list of issues addressed in this release, see [.NET Aspire GitHub repository—9.1 milestone](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A9.1%20).

## .NET Aspire templates

.NET Aspire provides a set of solution and project templates. These templates are available in your favorite .NET developer integrated environment. You can use these templates to create full .NET Aspire solutions, or add individual projects to existing .NET Aspire solutions.

### Install the .NET Aspire templates

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

To install the .NET Aspire templates in Visual Studio, you need to manually install them unless you're using Visual Studio 17.12 or later. For Visual Studio 17.9 to 17.11, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio.
1. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
1. Run the following command to install the templates:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates
  ```

For Visual Studio 17.12 or later, the .NET Aspire templates are installed automatically.

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="vscode,dotnet-cli"

To install these templates, use the [dotnet new install](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-install) command, passing in the `Aspire.ProjectTemplates` NuGet identifier.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates
```

To install a specific version, append the version number to the package name:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates::9.0.0
```

> [!TIP]
> If you already have the .NET Aspire workload installed, you need to pass the `--force` flag to overwrite the existing templates. Feel free to uninstall the .NET Aspire workload.

:::zone-end

### List the .NET Aspire templates

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

The .NET Aspire templates are installed automatically when you install Visual Studio 17.9 or later. To see what .NET Aspire templates are available, select **File** > **New** > **Project** in Visual Studio, and search for "Aspire" in the search bar (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>). You'll see a list of available .NET Aspire project templates:

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio: Create new project and search for 'Aspire'." lightbox="media/vs-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="vscode"

To view the available templates in Visual Studio Code with the C# DevKit installed, select the **Create .NET Project** button when no folder is opened in the **Explorer** view:

:::image type="content" source="media/vscode-create-dotnet-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio Code: Create .NET Project button." lightbox="media/vscode-create-dotnet-proj.png":::

Then, search for "Aspire" in the search bar to see the available .NET Aspire project templates:

:::image type="content" source="media/vscode-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio Code: Create new project and search for 'Aspire'." lightbox="media/vscode-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="dotnet-cli"

To verify that the .NET Aspire templates are installed, use the [dotnet new list](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-list) command, passing in the `aspire` template name:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new list aspire
```

Your console output should look like the following:

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-new-list-aspire-output](includes/dotnet-new-list-aspire-output.md)]

:::zone-end

For more information, see [.NET Aspire templates](aspire-sdk-templates.md).

## Container runtime

.NET Aspire projects are designed to run in containers. You can use either Docker Desktop or Podman as your container runtime. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is the most common container runtime. [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) is an open-source daemonless alternative to Docker, that can build and run Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers. If your host environment has both Docker and Podman installed, .NET Aspire defaults to using Docker. You can instruct .NET Aspire to use Podman instead, by setting the `DOTNET_ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` environment variable to `podman`:

## [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export DOTNET_ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman
```

For more information, see [Install Podman on Linux](https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux).

## [Windows](#tab/windows)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME", "podman", "User")
```

For more information, see [Install Podman on Windows](https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-mac--windows).

---

## .NET Aspire dashboard

.NET Aspire templates that expose the [app host](app-host-overview.md) project also include a useful developer [dashboard](dashboard/overview.md) that's used to monitor and inspect various aspects of your app, such as logs, traces, and environment configurations. This dashboard is designed to improve the local development experience and provides an overview of the overall state and structure of your app.

The .NET Aspire dashboard is only visible while the app is running and starts automatically when you start the _*.AppHost_ project. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code launch both your app and the .NET Aspire dashboard for you automatically in your browser. If you start the app using the .NET CLI, copy and paste the dashboard URL from the output into your browser, or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and select the link (if your terminal supports hyperlinks).

:::image type="content" source="dashboard/media/explore/dotnet-run-login-url.png" lightbox="dashboard/media/explore/dotnet-run-login-url.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to launch the dashboard using the CLI.":::

The left navigation provides links to the different parts of the dashboard, each of which you explore in the following sections.

:::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/aspire-dashboard.png" lightbox="../get-started/media/aspire-dashboard.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard Projects page.":::

The .NET Aspire dashboard is also available in a standalone mode. For more information, see [Standalone .NET Aspire dashboard](dashboard/standalone.md).

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

## Visual Studio tooling

# .NET Aspire templates

There are a number of .NET Aspire project templates available to you. You can use these templates to create full .NET Aspire solutions, or add individual projects to existing .NET Aspire solutions.

The .NET Aspire templates are available in the [📦 Aspire.ProjectTemplates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.ProjectTemplates) NuGet package.

## Available templates

The .NET Aspire templates allow you to create new apps pre-configured with the .NET Aspire solutions structure and default settings. These projects also provide a unified debugging experience across the different resources of your app.

.NET Aspire templates are available in two categories: solution templates and project templates. Solution templates create a new .NET Aspire solution with multiple projects, while project templates create individual projects that can be added to an existing .NET Aspire solution.

### Solution templates

The following .NET Aspire solution templates are available, assume the solution is named _AspireSample_:

<a name="empty-app"></a>

- **.NET Aspire Empty App**: A minimal .NET Aspire project that includes the following:

  - [**AspireSample.AppHost**](#app-host): An orchestrator project designed to connect and configure the different projects and services of your app.
  - [**AspireSample.ServiceDefaults**](#service-defaults): A .NET Aspire shared project to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution related to [resilience](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md), and [telemetry](telemetry.md).

<a name="starter-app"></a>

- **.NET Aspire Starter App**: In addition to the [**.AppHost**](#app-host) and [**.ServiceDefaults**](#service-defaults) projects, the .NET Aspire Starter App also includes the following:

  - **AspireSample.ApiService**: An [ASP.NET Core Minimal API](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis) project is used to provide data to the frontend. This project depends on the shared [**AspireSample.ServiceDefaults**](#service-defaults) project.
  - **AspireSample.Web**: An [ASP.NET Core Blazor App](/aspnet/core/blazor) project with default .NET Aspire service configurations, this project depends on the [**AspireSample.ServiceDefaults**](#service-defaults) project.
  - **AspireSample.Test**: Either an [MSTest](#mstest-project), [NUnit](#nunit-project), or [xUnit](#xunit-project) test project with project references to the [**AspireSample.AppHost**](#app-host) and an example _WebTests.cs_ file demonstrating an integration test.

### Project templates

The following .NET Aspire project templates are available:

<a name="app-host"></a>

- **.NET Aspire App Host**: A standalone **.AppHost** project that can be used to orchestrate and manage the different projects and services of your app.

<a name="mstest-project"></a>
<a name="nunit-project"></a>
<a name="xunit-project"></a>

- **.NET Aspire Test projects**: These project templates are used to create test projects for your .NET Aspire app, and they're intended to represent functional and integration tests. The test projects include the following templates:

  - **MSTest**: A project that contains MSTest integration of a .NET Aspire AppHost project.
  - **NUnit**: A project that contains NUnit integration of a .NET Aspire AppHost project.
  - **xUnit**: A project that contains xUnit.net integration of a .NET Aspire AppHost project.
  
  For more information on the test templates, see [Testing in .NET Aspire](testing.md).

<a name="service-defaults"></a>

- **.NET Aspire Service Defaults**: A standalone **.ServiceDefaults** project that can be used to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution related to [resilience](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md), and [telemetry](./telemetry.md).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The service defaults project template takes a `FrameworkReference` dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. This may not be ideal for some project types. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](service-defaults.md).

## Create solutions and projects using templates

To create a .NET Aspire solution or project, use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the .NET CLI, and base it on the available templates. Explore additional .NET Aspire templates in the [.NET Aspire samples](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples) repository.

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

To create a .NET Aspire project using Visual Studio, search for *Aspire* in the Visual Studio new project window and select your desired template.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" lightbox="media/vs-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio: .NET Aspire templates.":::

Follow the prompts to configure your project or solution from the template, and then select **Create**.

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="vscode"

To create a .NET Aspire project using Visual Studio Code, search for *Aspire* in the Visual Studio Code new project window and select your desired template.

:::image type="content" source="media/vscode-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" lightbox="media/vscode-create-dotnet-aspire-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio Code: .NET Aspire templates.":::

Select the desired location, enter a name, and select **Create**.

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="dotnet-cli"

To create a .NET Aspire solution or project using the .NET CLI, use the [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command and specify which template you would like to create. Consider the following examples:

To create a basic [.NET Aspire app host](app-host-overview.md) project targeting the latest .NET version:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire-apphost
```

To create a .NET Aspire starter app, which is a full solution with a sample UI and backing API included:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire-starter
```

> [!TIP]
> .NET Aspire templates default to using the latest .NET version, even when using an earlier version of the .NET CLI. To manually specify the .NET version, use the `--framework <tfm>` option, e.g. to create a basic [.NET Aspire app host](app-host-overview.md) project targeting .NET 8:
>
> ```dotnetcli
> dotnet new aspire-apphost --framework net8.0
> ```

:::zone-end

# .NET Aspire and GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) offers a cloud-hosted development environment based on Visual Studio Code. It can be accessed directly from a web browser or through Visual Studio Code locally, where Visual Studio Code acts as a client connecting to a cloud-hosted backend. With .NET Aspire 9.1, comes logic to better support GitHub Codespaces including:

- Automatically configure port forwarding with the correct protocol.
- Automatically translate URLs in the .NET Aspire dashboard.

Before .NET Aspire 9.1 it was still possible to use .NET Aspire within a GitHub Codespace, however more manual configuration was required.

## GitHub Codespaces vs. Dev Containers

GitHub Codespaces builds upon Visual Studio Code and the [Dev Containers specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/). In addition to supporting GitHub Codespaces, .NET Aspire 9.1 enhances support for using Visual Studio Code and locally hosted Dev Containers. While the experiences are similar, there are some differences. For more information, see [.NET Aspire and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](dev-containers.md).

## Quick start using template repository

To configure GitHub Codespaces for .NET Aspire, use the _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json_ file in your repository. The simplest way to get started is by creating a new repository from our [template repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer). Consider the following steps:

1. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=aspire-devcontainer&template_owner=dotnet) using our template.

    :::image source="media/new-repository-from-template.png" lightbox="media/new-repository-from-template.png" alt-text="Create new repository.":::

    Once you provide the details and select **Create repository**, the repository is created and shown in GitHub.

1. From the new repository, select on the Code button and select the Codespaces tab and then select **Create codespace on main**.

    :::image source="media/create-codespace-from-repository.png" lightbox="media/create-codespace-from-repository.png" alt-text="Create codespace":::

    After you select **Create codespace on main**, you navigate to a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. Before you use the Codespace, the containerized development environment needs to be prepared. This process happens automatically on the server and you can review progress by selecting the **Building codespace** link on the notification in the bottom right of the browser window.

    :::image source="media/building-codespace-image.png" lightbox="media/building-codespace-image.png" alt-text="Building codespace":::

    When the container image has finished being built the **Terminal** prompt appears which signals that the environment is ready to be interacted with.

    :::image source="media/codespace-terminal.png" lightbox="media/codespace-terminal.png" alt-text="Codespace terminal prompt":::

    At this point, the .NET Aspire templates have been installed and the ASP.NET Core developer certificate has been added and accepted.

1. Create a new .NET Aspire project using the starter template.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new aspire-starter --name HelloAspire
    ```

    This results in many files and folders being created in the repository, which are visible in the **Explorer** panel on the left side of the window.

    :::image source="media/codespaces-explorer-panel.png" lightbox="media/codespaces-explorer-panel.png" alt-text="Codespaces Explorer panel":::

1. Launch the app host via the _HelloAspire.AppHost/Program.cs_ file, by selecting the **Run project** button near the top-right corner of the **Tab bar**.

    :::image source="media/codespace-launch-apphost.png" lightbox="media/codespace-launch-apphost.png" alt-text="Launch app host in Codespace":::

    After a few moments the **Debug Console** panel is displayed, and it includes a link to the .NET Aspire dashboard exposed on a GitHub Codespaces endpoint with the authentication token.

    :::image source="media/codespaces-debug-console.png" lightbox="media/codespaces-debug-console.png" alt-text="Codespaces debug console":::

1. Open the .NET Aspire dashboard by selecting the dashboard URL in the **Debug Console**. This opens the .NET Aspire dashboard in a separate tab within your browser.

    You notice on the dashboard that all HTTP/HTTPS endpoints defined on resources have had their typical `localhost` address translated to a unique fully qualified subdomain on the `app.github.dev` domain.

    :::image source="media/codespaces-translated-urls.png" lightbox="media/codespaces-translated-urls.png" alt-text="Codespaces translated URLs":::

    Traffic to each of these endpoints is automatically forwarded to the underlying process or container running within the Codespace. This includes development time tools such as PgAdmin and Redis Insight.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In addition to the authentication token embedded within the URL of the dashboard link of the **Debug Console**, endpoints also require authentication via your GitHub identity to avoid port forwarded endpoints being accessible to everyone. For more information on port forwarding in GitHub Codespaces, see [Forwarding ports in your codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace?tool=webui).

1. Commit changes to the GitHub repository.

    GitHub Codespaces doesn't automatically commit your changes to the branch you're working on in GitHub. You have to use the **Source Control** panel to stage and commit the changes and push them back to the repository.

    Working in a GitHub Codespace is similar to working with Visual Studio Code on your own machine. You can checkout different branches and push changes just like you normally would. In addition, you can easily spin up multiple Codespaces simultaneously if you want to quickly work on another branch without disrupting your existing debug session. For more information, see [Developing in a codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace?tool=webui).

1. Clean up your Codespace.

    GitHub Codespaces are temporary development environments and while you might use one for an extended period of time, they should be considered a disposable resource that you recreate as needed (with all of the customization/setup contained within the _devcontainer.json_ and associated configuration files).

    To delete your GitHub Codespace, visit the GitHub Codespaces page. This shows you a list of all of your Codespaces. From here you can perform management operations on each Codespace, including deleting them.

    GitHub charges for the use of Codespaces. For more information, see [Managing the cost of GitHub Codespaces in your organization](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization).

    > [!NOTE]
    > .NET Aspire supports the use of Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code independent of GitHub Codespaces. For more information on how to use Dev Containers locally, see [.NET Aspire and Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code](dev-containers.md).

## Manually configuring _devcontainer.json_

The preceding walkthrough demonstrates the streamlined process of creating a GitHub Codespace using the .NET Aspire Devcontainer template. If you already have an existing repository and wish to utilize Devcontainer functionality with .NET Aspire, add a _devcontainer.json_ file to the _.devcontainer_ folder within your repository:

```Directory
└───📂 .devcontainer
     └─── devcontainer.json
```

The [template repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer) contains a copy of the _devcontainer.json_ file that you can use as a starting point, which should be sufficient for .NET Aspire. The following JSON represents the latest version of the _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json_ file from the template:

:::code language="json" source="~/aspire-devcontainer/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json":::

## Speed up Codespace creation

Creating a GitHub Codespace can take some time as it prepares the underlying container image. To expedite this process, you can utilize _prebuilds_ to significantly reduce the creation time to approximately 30-60 seconds (exact timing might vary). For more information on GitHub Codespaces prebuilds, see [GitHub Codespaces prebuilds](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds).

description: Learn how to use .NET Aspire with Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code.

# .NET Aspire and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers

The [Dev Containers Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) provides a way for development teams to develop within a containerized environment where all dependencies are preconfigured. With .NET Aspire 9.1, there's added logic to better support working with .NET Aspire within a Dev Container environment by automatically configuring port forwarding.

Before .NET Aspire 9.1, it possible to use .NET Aspire within a Dev Container, however more manual configuration was required.

## Dev Containers vs. GitHub Codespaces

Using Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code is similar to using GitHub Codespaces. With the release of .NET Aspire 9.1, support for both Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces was enhanced. Although the experiences are similar, there are some differences. For more information on using .NET Aspire with GitHub Codespaces, see [.NET Aspire and GitHub Codespaces](github-codespaces.md).

## Quick start using template repository

To configure Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code, use the _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json file in your repository. The simplest way to get started is by creating a new repository from our [template repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer). Consider the following steps:

1. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=aspire-devcontainer&template_owner=dotnet) using our template.

    :::image source="media/new-repository-from-template.png" lightbox="media/new-repository-from-template.png" alt-text="Create new repository.":::

    Once you provide the details and select **Create repository**, the repository is created and shown in GitHub.

1. Clone the repository to your local developer workstation using the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    git clone https://github.com/<org>/<username>/<repository>
    ```

1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code. After a few moments Visual Studio Code detects the _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json_ file and prompt to open the repository inside a container. Select whichever option is most appropriate for your workflow.

    :::image source="media/reopen-in-container.png" lightbox="media/reopen-in-container.png" alt-text="Prompt to open repository inside a container.":::

    After a few moments, the list of files become visible and the local build of the dev container will be completed.

    :::image source="media/devcontainer-build-completed.png" lightbox="media/devcontainer-build-completed.png" alt-text="Dev Container build completed.":::

1. Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd>) and create a new .NET Aspire project using the `dotnet` command-line.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new aspire-starter -n HelloAspire
    ```

    After a few moments, the project will be created and initial dependencies restored.

1. Open the _ProjectName.AppHost/Program.cs_ file in the editor and select the run button on the top right corner of the editor window.

    :::image source="media/vscode-run-button.png" lightbox="media/vscode-run-button.png" alt-text="Run button in editor.":::

    Visual Studio Code builds and starts the .NET Aspire app host and automatically opens the .NET Aspire Dashboard. Because the endpoints hosted in the container are using a self-signed certificate the first time, you access an endpoint for a specific Dev Container you're presented with a certificate error.

    :::image source="media/browser-certificate-error.png" lightbox="media/browser-certificate-error.png" alt-text="Browser certificate error.":::

    The certificate error is expected. Once you've confirmed that the URL being requested corresponds to the dashboard in the Dev Container you can ignore this warning.

    :::image source="media/aspire-dashboard-in-devcontainer.png" lightbox="media/aspire-dashboard-in-devcontainer.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard running in Dev Container.":::

    .NET Aspire automatically configures forwarded ports so that when you select on the endpoints in the .NET Aspire dashboard they're tunneled to processes and nested containers within the Dev Container.

1. Commit changes to the GitHub repository

    After successfully creating the .NET Aspire project and verifying that it launches and you can access the dashboard, it's a good idea to commit the changes to the repository.

## Manually configuring _devcontainer.json_

The preceding walkthrough demonstrates the streamlined process of creating a Dev Container using the .NET Aspire Dev Container template. If you already have an existing repository and wish to utilize Dev Container functionality with .NET Aspire, add a _devcontainer.json_ file to the _.devcontainer_ folder within your repository:

```Directory
└───📂 .devcontainer
     └─── devcontainer.json
```

The [template repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer) contains a copy of the _devcontainer.json_ file that you can use as a starting point, which should be sufficient for .NET Aspire. The following JSON represents the latest version of the _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json_ file from the template:

:::code language="json" source="~/aspire-devcontainer/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json":::

title: .NET Aspire orchestration overview
description: Learn the fundamental concepts of .NET Aspire orchestration and explore the various APIs for adding resources and expressing dependencies.

# .NET Aspire orchestration overview

.NET Aspire provides APIs for expressing resources and dependencies within your distributed application. In addition to these APIs, [there's tooling](setup-tooling.md#install-net-aspire-prerequisites) that enables several compelling scenarios. The orchestrator is intended for _local development_ purposes and isn't supported in production environments.

<span id="terminology"></span>

Before continuing, consider some common terminology used in .NET Aspire:

- **App model**: A collection of resources that make up your distributed application (<xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication>), defined within the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel> namespace. For a more formal definition, see [Define the app model](#define-the-app-model).
- **App host/Orchestrator project**: The .NET project that orchestrates the _app model_, named with the _*.AppHost_ suffix (by convention).
- **Resource**: A [resource](#built-in-resource-types) is a dependent part of an application, such as a .NET project, container, executable, database, cache, or cloud service. It represents any part of the application that can be managed or referenced.
- **Integration**: An integration is a NuGet package for either the _app host_ that models a _resource_ or a package that configures a client for use in a consuming app. For more information, see [.NET Aspire integrations overview](integrations-overview.md).
- **Reference**: A reference defines a connection between resources, expressed as a dependency using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> API. For more information, see [Reference resources](#reference-resources) or [Reference existing resources](#reference-existing-resources).

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Aspire's orchestration is designed to enhance your _local development_ experience by simplifying the management of your cloud-native app's configuration and interconnections. While it's an invaluable tool for development, it's not intended to replace production environment systems like [Kubernetes](../deployment/overview.md#deploy-to-kubernetes), which are specifically designed to excel in that context.

## Define the app model

.NET Aspire empowers you to seamlessly build, provision, deploy, configure, test, run, and observe your distributed applications. All of these capabilities are achieved through the utilization of an _app model_ that outlines the resources in your .NET Aspire solution and their relationships. These resources encompass projects, executables, containers, and external services and cloud resources that your app depends on. Within every .NET Aspire solution, there's a designated [App host project](#app-host-project), where the app model is precisely defined using methods available on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder>. This builder is obtained by invoking <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

```csharp
// Create a new app model builder
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// TODO:
//   Add resources to the app model
//   Express dependencies between resources

builder.Build().Run();
```

## App host project

The app host project handles running all of the projects that are part of the .NET Aspire project. In other words, it's responsible for orchestrating all apps within the app model. The project itself is a .NET executable project that references the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.AppHost](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AppHost) NuGet package, sets the `IsAspireHost` property to `true`, and references the [.NET Aspire SDK](dotnet-aspire-sdk.md):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.1.0" />
    
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
        <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.1.0" />
    </ItemGroup>

    <!-- Omitted for brevity -->

</Project>
```

The following code describes an app host `Program` with two project references and a Redis cache:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .WithReference(cache)
       .WaitFor(cache)
       .WithReference(apiService)
       .WaitFor(apiService);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new app model builder using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder%2A> method.
- Adds a Redis `cache` resource named "cache" using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedis*> method.
- Adds a project resource named "apiservice" using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> method.
- Adds a project resource named "webfrontend" using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> method.
  - Specifies that the project has external HTTP endpoints using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExternalHttpEndpoints%2A> method.
  - Adds a reference to the `cache` resource and waits for it to be ready using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WaitFor*> methods.
  - Adds a reference to the `apiservice` resource and waits for it to be ready using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WaitFor*> methods.
- Builds and runs the app model using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationBuilder.Build%2A> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.Run%2A> methods.

The example code uses the [.NET Aspire Redis hosting integration](../caching/stackexchange-redis-integration.md#hosting-integration).

To help visualize the relationship between the app host project and the resources it describes, consider the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="../media/app-host-resource-diagram.png" lightbox="../media/app-host-resource-diagram.png" alt-text="The relationship between the projects in the .NET Aspire Starter Application template.":::

Each resource must be uniquely named. This diagram shows each resource and the relationships between them. The container resource is named "cache" and the project resources are named "apiservice" and "webfrontend". The web frontend project references the cache and API service projects. When you're expressing references in this way, the web frontend project is saying that it depends on these two resources, the "cache" and "apiservice" respectively.

## Built-in resource types

.NET Aspire projects are made up of a set of resources. The primary base resource types in the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.AppHost](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AppHost) NuGet package are described in the following table:

| Method | Resource type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ProjectResource> | A .NET project, for example, an ASP.NET Core web app. |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.AddContainer%2A> | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource> | A container image, such as a Docker image. |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExecutableResourceBuilderExtensions.AddExecutable%2A> | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ExecutableResource> | An executable file, such as a [Node.js app](../get-started/build-aspire-apps-with-nodejs.md). |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddParameter%2A> | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource> | A parameter resource that can be used to [express external parameters](external-parameters.md). |

Project resources represent .NET projects that are part of the app model. When you add a project reference to the app host project, the .NET Aspire SDK generates a type in the `Projects` namespace for each referenced project. For more information, see [.NET Aspire SDK: Project references](dotnet-aspire-sdk.md#project-references).

To add a project to the app model, use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Adds the project "apiservice" of type "Projects.AspireApp_ApiService".
var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice");
```

Projects can be replicated and scaled out by adding multiple instances of the same project to the app model. To configure replicas, use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReplicas*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Adds the project "apiservice" of type "Projects.AspireApp_ApiService".
var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
                        .WithReplicas(3);
```

The preceding code adds three replicas of the "apiservice" project resource to the app model. For more information, see [.NET Aspire dashboard: Resource replicas](dashboard/explore.md#resource-replicas).

## Configure explicit resource start

Project, executable and container resources are automatically started with your distributed application by default. A resource can be configured to wait for an explicit startup instruction with the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExplicitStart*> method. A resource configured with <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExplicitStart*> is initialized with <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.NotStarted?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase("postgresdb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_DbMigration>("dbmigration")
       .WithReference(postgresdb)
       .WithExplicitStart();
```

In the preceeding code the "dbmigration" resource is configured to not automatically start with the distributed application.

Resources with explicit start can be started from the .NET Aspire dashboard by clicking the "Start" command. For more information, see [.NET Aspire dashboard: Stop or Start a resource](dashboard/explore.md#stop-or-start-a-resource).

## Reference resources

A reference represents a dependency between resources. For example, you can probably imagine a scenario where you a web frontend depends on a Redis cache. Consider the following example app host `Program` C# code:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
       .WithReference(cache);
```

The "webfrontend" project resource uses <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> to add a dependency on the "cache" container resource. These dependencies can represent connection strings or [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) information. In the preceding example, an environment variable is _injected_ into the "webfrontend" resource with the name `ConnectionStrings__cache`. This environment variable contains a connection string that the `webfrontend` uses to connect to Redis via the [.NET Aspire Redis integration](../caching/stackexchange-redis-caching-overview.md), for example, `ConnectionStrings__cache="localhost:62354"`.

### Waiting for resources

In some cases, you might want to wait for a resource to be ready before starting another resource. For example, you might want to wait for a database to be ready before starting an API that depends on it. To express this dependency, use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WaitFor*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase("postgresdb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
       .WithReference(postgresdb)
       .WaitFor(postgresdb);
```

In the preceding code, the "apiservice" project resource waits for the "postgresdb" database resource to enter the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.Running?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The example code shows the [.NET Aspire PostgreSQL integration](../database/postgresql-integration.md), but the same pattern can be applied to other resources.

Other cases might warrant waiting for a resource to run to completion, either <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.Exited?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.Finished?displayProperty=nameWithType> before the dependent resource starts. To wait for a resource to run to completion, use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WaitForCompletion*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase("postgresdb");

var migration = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Migration>("migration")
                       .WithReference(postgresdb)
                       .WaitFor(postgresdb);

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
       .WithReference(postgresdb)
       .WaitForCompletion(migration);
```

In the preceding code, the "apiservice" project resource waits for the "migration" project resource to run to completion before starting. The "migration" project resource waits for the "postgresdb" database resource to enter the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.Running?displayProperty=nameWithType>. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to run a database migration before starting the API service, for example.

#### Forcing resource start in the dashboard

Waiting for a resource can be bypassed using the "Start" command in the dashboard. Clicking "Start" on a waiting resource in the dashboard instructs it to start immediately without waiting for the resource to be healthy or completed. This can be useful when you want to test a resource immediately and don't want to wait for the app to be in the right state.

### APIs for adding and expressing resources

.NET Aspire [hosting integrations](integrations-overview.md#hosting-integrations) and [client integrations](integrations-overview.md#client-integrations) are both delivered as NuGet packages, but they serve different purposes. While _client integrations_ provide client library configuration for consuming apps outside the scope of the app host, _hosting integrations_ provide APIs for expressing resources and dependencies within the app host. For more information, see [.NET Aspire integrations overview: Integration responsibilities](integrations-overview.md#integration-responsibilities).

### Express container resources

To express a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource> you add it to an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> instance by calling the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.AddContainer%2A> method:

#### [Docker](#tab/docker)

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var ollama = builder.AddContainer("ollama", "ollama/ollama")
    .WithBindMount("ollama", "/root/.ollama")
    .WithBindMount("./ollamaconfig", "/usr/config")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 11434, targetPort: 11434, name: "ollama")
    .WithEntrypoint("/usr/config/entrypoint.sh")
    .WithContainerRuntimeArgs("--gpus=all");
```

For more information, see [GPU support in Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/gpu/).

#### [Podman](#tab/podman)

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var ollama = builder.AddContainer("ollama", "ollama/ollama")
    .WithBindMount("ollama", "/root/.ollama")
    .WithBindMount("./ollamaconfig", "/usr/config")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 11434, targetPort: 11434, name: "ollama")
    .WithEntrypoint("/usr/config/entrypoint.sh")
    .WithContainerRuntimeArgs("--device", "nvidia.com/gpu=all");
```

For more information, see [GPU support in Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19005).

---

The preceding code adds a container resource named "ollama" with the image `ollama/ollama`. The container resource is configured with multiple bind mounts, a named HTTP endpoint, an entrypoint that resolves to Unix shell script, and container run arguments with the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithContainerRuntimeArgs%2A> method.

#### Customize container resources

All <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource> subclasses can be customized to meet your specific requirements. This can be useful when using a [hosting integration](integrations-overview.md#hosting-integrations) that models a container resource, but requires modifications. When you have an `IResourceBuilder<ContainerResource>` you can chain calls to any of the available APIs to modify the container resource. .NET Aspire container resources typically point to pinned tags, but you might want to use the `latest` tag instead.

To help exemplify this, imagine a scenario where you're using the [.NET Aspire Redis integration](../caching/stackexchange-redis-integration.md). If the Redis integration relies on the `7.4` tag and you want to use the `latest` tag instead, you can chain a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithImageTag*> API:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache")
                   .WithImageTag("latest");

// Instead of using the "7.4" tag, the "cache" 
// container resource now uses the "latest" tag.
```

For more information and additional APIs available, see <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions#methods>.

#### Container resource lifecycle

When the app host is run, the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource> is used to determine what container image to create and start. Under the hood, .NET Aspire runs the container using the defined container image by delegating calls to the appropriate OCI-compliant container runtime, either Docker or Podman. The following commands are used:

#### [Docker](#tab/docker)

First, the container is created using the `docker container create` command. Then, the container is started using the `docker container start` command.

- [docker container create](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/create/): Creates a new container from the specified image, without starting it.
- [docker container start](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/start/): Start one or more stopped containers.

These commands are used instead of `docker run` to manage attached container networks, volumes, and ports. Calling these commands in this order allows any IP (network configuration) to already be present at initial startup.

#### [Podman](#tab/podman)

First, the container is created using the `podman container create` command. Then, the container is started using the `podman container start` command.

- [podman container create](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-create.1.html): Creates a writable container layer over the specified image and prepares it for running.
- [podman container start](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-start.1.html): Start one or more stopped containers.

These commands are used instead of `podman run` to manage attached container networks, volumes, and ports. Calling these commands in this order allows any IP (network configuration) to already be present at initial startup.

---

Beyond the base resource types, <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ProjectResource>, <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource>, and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ExecutableResource>, .NET Aspire provides extension methods to add common resources to your app model. For more information, see [Hosting integrations](integrations-overview.md#hosting-integrations).

#### Container resource lifetime

By default, container resources use the _session_ container lifetime. This means that every time the app host process is started, the container is created and started. When the app host stops, the container is stopped and removed. Container resources can opt-in to a _persistent_ lifetime to avoid unnecessary restarts and use persisted container state. To achieve this, chain a call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithLifetime*?displayProperty=nameWithType> API and pass <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerLifetime.Persistent?displayProperty=nameWithType>:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var ollama = builder.AddContainer("ollama", "ollama/ollama")
    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);
```

The preceding code adds a container resource named "ollama" with the image "ollama/ollama" and a persistent lifetime.

### Connection string and endpoint references

It's common to express dependencies between project resources. Consider the following example code:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
       .WithReference(cache)
       .WithReference(apiservice);
```

Project-to-project references are handled differently than resources that have well-defined connection strings. Instead of connection string being injected into the "webfrontend" resource, environment variables to support service discovery are injected.

| Method | Environment variable |
|--|--|
| `WithReference(cache)` | `ConnectionStrings__cache="localhost:62354"` |
| `WithReference(apiservice)` | `services__apiservice__http__0="http://localhost:5455"` <br /> `services__apiservice__https__0="https://localhost:7356"` |

Adding a reference to the "apiservice" project results in service discovery environment variables being added to the frontend. This is because typically, project-to-project communication occurs over HTTP/gRPC. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md).

To get specific endpoints from a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource> or an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ExecutableResource>, use one of the following endpoint APIs:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint*>
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithHttpEndpoint*>
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithHttpsEndpoint*>

Then call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.GetEndpoint*> API to get the endpoint which can be used to reference the endpoint in the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var customContainer = builder.AddContainer("myapp", "mycustomcontainer")
                             .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 9043, name: "endpoint");

var endpoint = customContainer.GetEndpoint("endpoint");

var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
                        .WithReference(endpoint);
```

| Method                    | Environment variable                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `WithReference(endpoint)` | `services__myapp__endpoint__0=https://localhost:9043` |

The `port` parameter is the port that the container is listening on. For more information on container ports, see [Container ports](networking-overview.md#container-ports). For more information on service discovery, see [.NET Aspire service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md).

### Service endpoint environment variable format

In the preceding section, the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> method is used to express dependencies between resources. When service endpoints result in environment variables being injected into the dependent resource, the format might not be obvious. This section provides details on this format.

When one resource depends on another resource, the app host injects environment variables into the dependent resource. These environment variables configure the dependent resource to connect to the resource it depends on. The format of the environment variables is specific to .NET Aspire and expresses service endpoints in a way that is compatible with [Service Discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md).

Service endpoint environment variable names are prefixed with `services__` (double underscore), then the service name, the endpoint name, and finally the index. The index supports multiple endpoints for a single service, starting with `0` for the first endpoint and incrementing for each endpoint.

Consider the following environment variable examples:

```Environment
services__apiservice__http__0
```

The preceding environment variable expresses the first HTTP endpoint for the `apiservice` service. The value of the environment variable is the URL of the service endpoint. A named endpoint might be expressed as follows:

```Environment
services__apiservice__myendpoint__0
```

In the preceding example, the `apiservice` service has a named endpoint called `myendpoint`. The value of the environment variable is the URL of the service endpoint.

## Reference existing resources

Some situations warrant that you reference an existing resource, perhaps one that is deployed to a cloud provider. For example, you might want to reference an Azure database. In this case, you'd rely on the [Execution context](#execution-context) to dynamically determine whether the app host is running in "run" mode or "publish" mode. If you're running locally and want to rely on a cloud resource, you can use the `IsRunMode` property to conditionally add the reference. You might choose to instead create the resource in publish mode. Some [hosting integrations](integrations-overview.md#hosting-integrations) support providing a connection string directly, which can be used to reference an existing resource.

Likewise, there might be use cases where you want to integrate .NET Aspire into an existing solution. One common approach is to add the .NET Aspire app host project to an existing solution. Within your app host, you express dependencies by adding project references to the app host and [building out the app model](#define-the-app-model). For example, one project might depend on another. These dependencies are expressed using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> method. For more information, see [Add .NET Aspire to an existing .NET app](../get-started/add-aspire-existing-app.md).

## App host life cycles

The .NET Aspire app host exposes several life cycles that you can hook into by implementing the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface. The following lifecycle methods are available:

| Order | Method | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **1** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.BeforeStartAsync%2A> | Executes before the distributed application starts. |
| **2** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.AfterEndpointsAllocatedAsync%2A> | Executes after the orchestrator allocates endpoints for resources in the application model. |
| **3** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.AfterResourcesCreatedAsync%2A> | Executes after the resource was created by the orchestrator. |

While the app host provides life cycle hooks, you might want to register custom events. For more information, see [Eventing in .NET Aspire](../app-host/eventing.md).

### Register a life cycle hook

To register a life cycle hook, implement the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface and register the hook with the app host using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.LifecycleHookServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLifecycleHook*> API:

:::code source="snippets/lifecycles/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Program.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Implements the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface as a `LifecycleLogger`.
- Registers the life cycle hook with the app host using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.LifecycleHookServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLifecycleHook*> API.
- Logs a message for all the events.

When this app host is run, the life cycle hook is executed for each event. The following output is generated:

```Output
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      BeforeStartAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Aspire version: 9.0.0
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Distributed application starting.
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Application host directory is: ..\AspireApp\AspireApp.AppHost
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      AfterEndpointsAllocatedAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:17043
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17043/login?t=d80f598bc8a64c7ee97328a1cbd55d72
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      AfterResourcesCreatedAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Distributed application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

The preferred way to hook into the app host life cycle is to use the eventing API. For more information, see [Eventing in .NET Aspire](../app-host/eventing.md).

## Execution context

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> exposes an execution context (<xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationExecutionContext>), which provides information about the current execution of the app host. This context can be used to evaluate whether or not the app host is executing as "run" mode, or as part of a publish operation. Consider the following properties:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationExecutionContext.IsRunMode%2A>: Returns `true` if the current operation is running.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationExecutionContext.IsPublishMode%2A>: Returns `true` if the current operation is publishing.

This information can be useful when you want to conditionally execute code based on the current operation. Consider the following example that demonstrates using the `IsRunMode` property. In this case, an extension method is used to generate a stable node name for RabbitMQ for local development runs.

```csharp
private static IResourceBuilder<RabbitMQServerResource> RunWithStableNodeName(
    this IResourceBuilder<RabbitMQServerResource> builder)
{
    if (builder.ApplicationBuilder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode)
    {
        builder.WithEnvironment(context =>
        {
            // Set a stable node name so queue storage is consistent between sessions
            var nodeName = $"{builder.Resource.Name}@localhost";
            context.EnvironmentVariables["RABBITMQ_NODENAME"] = nodeName;
        });
    }

    return builder;
}
```

The execution context is often used to conditionally add resources or connection strings that point to existing resources. Consider the following example that demonstrates conditionally adding Redis or a connection string based on the execution context:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode
    ? builder.AddRedis("redis")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("redis");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApplication>("api")
       .WithReference(redis);

builder.Build().Run();
```

In the preceding code:

- If the app host is running in "run" mode, a Redis container resource is added.
- If the app host is running in "publish" mode, a connection string is added.

This logic can easily be inverted to connect to an existing Redis resource when you're running locally, and create a new Redis resource when you're publishing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET Aspire provides common APIs to control the modality of resource builders, allowing resources to behave differently based on the execution mode. The fluent APIs are prefixed with `RunAs*` and `PublishAs*`. The `RunAs*` APIs influence the local development (or run mode) behavior, whereas the `PublishAs*` APIs influence the publishing of the resource. For more information on how the Azure resources use these APIs, see [Use existing Azure resources](../azure/integrations-overview.md#use-existing-azure-resources).

## Resource relationships  

Resource relationships link resources together. Relationships are informational and don't impact an app's runtime behavior. Instead, they're used when displaying details about resources in the dashboard. For example, relationships are visible in the [dashboard's resource details](./dashboard/explore.md#resource-details), and `Parent` relationships control resource nesting on the resources page.

Relationships are automatically created by some app model APIs. For example:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> adds a relationship to the target resource with the type `Reference`.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WaitFor*> adds a relationship to the target resource with the type `WaitFor`.
- Adding a database to a DB container creates a relationship from the database to the container with the type `Parent`.

Relationships can also be explicitly added to the app model using <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithRelationship*> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithParentRelationship*>.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalogDb = builder.AddPostgres("postgres")
                       .WithDataVolume()
                       .AddDatabase("catalogdb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_CatalogDbMigration>("migration")
       .WithReference(catalogDb)
       .WithParentRelationship(catalogDb);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding example uses <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithParentRelationship*> to configure `catalogdb` database as the `migration` project's parent. The `Parent` relationship is special because it controls resource nesting on the resource page. In this example, `migration` is nested under `catalogdb`.

> [!NOTE]
> There's validation for parent relationships to prevent a resource from having multiple parents or creating a circular reference. These configurations can't be rendered in the UI, and the app model will throw an error.

title: Orchestrate Python apps in .NET Aspire
description: Learn how to integrate Python apps into a .NET Aspire app host project.
ms.date: 11/11/2024
---

# Orchestrate Python apps in .NET Aspire

In this article, you learn how to use Python apps in a .NET Aspire app host. The sample app in this article demonstrates launching a Python application. The Python extension for .NET Aspire requires the use of virtual environments.

[!INCLUDE [aspire-prereqs](../includes/aspire-prereqs.md)]

Additionally, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) on your machine. The sample app in this article was built with Python version 3.12.4 and pip version 24.1.2. To verify your Python and pip versions, run the following commands:

```python
python --version
```

```python
pip --version
```

To download Python (including `pip`), see the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Create a .NET Aspire project using the template

To get started launching a Python project in .NET Aspire first use the starter template to create a .NET Aspire application host:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire -o PythonSample
```

In the same terminal session, change directories into the newly created project:

```dotnetcli
cd PythonSample
```

Once the template has been created launch the app host with the following command to ensure that the app host and the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) launches successfully:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Once the app host starts it should be possible to click on the dashboard link in the console output. At this point the dashboard will not show any resources. Stop the app host by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Prepare a Python app

From your previous terminal session where you created the .NET Aspire solution, create a new directory to contain the Python source code.

```Console
mkdir hello-python
```

Change directories into the newly created _hello-python_ directory:

```Console
cd hello-python
```

### Initialize the Python virtual environment

To work with Python apps, they need to be within a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```python
python -m venv .venv
```

For more information on virtual environments, see the [Python: Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

To activate the virtual environment, enabling installation and usage of packages, run the following command:

### [Unix/macOS](#tab/bash)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### [Windows](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

Ensure that pip within the virtual environment is up-to-date by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Install Python packages

Install the Flask package by creating a _requirements.txt_ file in the _hello-python_ directory and adding the following line:

```python
Flask==3.0.3
```

Then, install the Flask package by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After Flask is installed, create a new file named _main.py_ in the _hello-python_ directory and add the following code:

```python
import os
import flask

app = flask.Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8111))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

The preceding code creates a simple Flask app that listens on port 8111 and returns the message `"Hello, World!"` when the root endpoint is accessed.

## Update the app host project

Install the Python hosting package by running the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add ../PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj package Aspire.Hosting.Python --version 9.0.0
```

After the package is installed, the project XML should have a new package reference similar to the following:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/PythonSample/PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj":::

Update the app host _Program.cs_ file to include the Python project, by calling the `AddPythonApp` API and specifying the project name, project path, and the entry point file:

:::code source="snippets/PythonSample/PythonSample.AppHost/Program.cs":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `AddPythonApp` API is experimental and may change in future releases. For more information, see [ASPIREHOSTINGPYTHON001](../diagnostics/overview.md#aspirehostingpython001).

## Run the app

Now that you've added the Python hosting package, updated the app host _Program.cs_ file, and created a Python project, you can run the app host:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project ../PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Launch the dashboard by clicking the link in the console output. The dashboard should display the Python project as a resource.

:::image source="media/python-dashboard.png" lightbox="media/python-dashboard.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Python sample app.":::

Select the **Endpoints** link to open the `hello-python` endpoint in a new browser tab. The browser should display the message "Hello, World!":

:::image source="media/python-hello-world.png" lightbox="media/python-hello-world.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Python sample app endpoint.":::

Stop the app host by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Add telemetry support.

To add a bit of observability, add telemetry to help monitor the dependant Python app. In the Python project, add the following OpenTelemetry package as a dependency in the _requirements.txt_ file:

:::code language="python" source="snippets/PythonSample/hello-python/requirements.txt" highlight="2-5":::

The preceding requirement update, adds the OpenTelemetry package and the OTLP exporter. Next, re-install the Python app requirements into the virtual environment by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The preceding command installs the OpenTelemetry package and the OTLP exporter, in the virtual environment. Update the Python app to include the OpenTelemetry code, by replacing the existing _main.py_ code with the following:

:::code language="python" source="snippets/PythonSample/hello-python/main.py":::

Update the app host project's _launchSettings.json_ file to include the `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` environment variable:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/PythonSample/PythonSample.AppHost/Properties/launchSettings.json":::

The `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` variable is required because when running locally the OpenTelemetry client in Python rejects the local development certificate. Launch the _app host_ again:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project ../PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Once the app host has launched navigate to the dashboard and note that in addition to console log output, structured logging is also being routed through to the dashboard.

:::image source="media/python-telemetry-in-dashboard.png" lightbox="media/python-telemetry-in-dashboard.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Structured logging from Python process.":::

## Summary

While there are several considerations that are beyond the scope of this article, you learned how to build .NET Aspire solution that integrates with Python. You also learned how to use the `AddPythonApp` API to host Python apps.

title: .NET Aspire app host configuration
description: Learn about the .NET Aspire app host configuration options.
ms.date: 11/21/2024
ms.topic: reference
---

# App host configuration

The app host project configures and starts your distributed application (<xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication>). When a `DistributedApplication` runs it reads configuration from the app host. Configuration is loaded from environment variables that are set on the app host and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationOptions>.

Configuration includes:

- Settings for hosting the resource service, such as the address and authentication options.
- Settings used to start the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md), such the dashboard's frontend and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) addresses.
- Internal settings that .NET Aspire uses to run the app host. These are set internally but can be accessed by integrations that extend .NET Aspire.

App host configuration is provided by the app host launch profile. The app host has a launch settings file call _launchSettings.json_ which has a list of launch profiles. Each launch profile is a collection of related options which defines how you would like `dotnet` to start your application.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17134;http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:21030",
        "DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:22057"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding launch settings file:

- Has one launch profile named `https`.
- Configures an .NET Aspire app host project:
  - The `applicationUrl` property configures the dashboard launch address (`ASPNETCORE_URLS`).
  - Environment variables such as `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL` and `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` are set on the app host.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire and launch profiles](../fundamentals/launch-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration described on this page is for .NET Aspire app host project. To configure the standalone dashboard, see [dashboard configuration](../fundamentals/dashboard/configuration.md).

## Common configuration

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` | `false` | Allows communication with the app host without https. `ASPNETCORE_URLS` (dashboard address) and `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` (app host resource service address) must be secured with HTTPS unless true. |
| `DOTNET_ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` | `docker` | Allows the user of alternative container runtimes for resources backed by containers. Possible values are `docker` (default) or `podman`. See [Setup and tooling overview for more details](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md).  |

## Resource service

A resource service is hosted by the app host. The resource service is used by the dashboard to fetch information about resources which are being orchestrated by .NET Aspire.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` | `null` | Configures the address of the resource service hosted by the app host. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. For example, `https://localhost:17037`. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_RESOURCESERVICE_APIKEY` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests made to the app host's resource service. The API key is required if the app host is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |

## Dashboard

By default, the dashboard is automatically started by the app host. The dashboard supports [its own set of configuration](../fundamentals/dashboard/configuration.md), and some settings can be configured from the app host.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | `null` | Dashboard address. Must be `https` unless `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` or `DistributedApplicationOptions.AllowUnsecuredTransport` is true. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. The value in launch settings is set on the `applicationUrls` property. |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | `Production` | Configures the environment the dashboard runs as. For more information, see [Use multiple environments in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments). |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL` | `http://localhost:18889` if no gRPC endpoint is configured. | Configures the dashboard OTLP gRPC address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. Set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `grpc`.  Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` | `null` | Configures the dashboard OTLP HTTP address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. If only `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` is configured then it is set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `http/protobuf`. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `null` | Overrides the CORS allowed origins configured in the dashboard. This setting replaces the default behavior of calculating allowed origins based on resource endpoints. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_BROWSERTOKEN` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | Configures the frontend browser token. This is the value that must be entered to access the dashboard when the auth mode is BrowserToken. If no browser token is specified then a new token is generated each time the app host is launched. |

## Internal

Internal settings are used by the app host and integrations. Internal settings aren't designed to be configured directly.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `AppHost:Directory` | The content root if there's no project. | Directory of the project where the app host is located. Accessible from the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.AppHostDirectory?displayProperty=nameWithType>. |
| `AppHost:Path` | The directory combined with the application name. | The path to the app host. It combines the directory with the application name. |
| `AppHost:Sha256` | It is created from the app host name when the app host is in publish mode. Otherwise it is created from the app host path. | Hex encoded hash for the current application. The hash is based on the location of the app on the current machine so it is stable between launches of the app host. |
| `AppHost:OtlpApiKey` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests sent to the dashboard OTLP service.

description: Learn how to add Dockerfiles to your .NET app model.

# Add Dockerfiles to your .NET app model

With .NET Aspire it's possible to specify a _Dockerfile_ to build when the [app host](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md) is started using either the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.AddDockerfile%2A> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithDockerfile%2A> extension methods.

## Add a Dockerfile to the app model

In the following example the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.AddDockerfile%2A> extension method is used to specify a container by referencing the context path for the container build.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var container = builder.AddDockerfile(
    "mycontainer", "relative/context/path");
```

Unless the context path argument is a rooted path the context path is interpreted as being relative to the app host projects directory (where the AppHost `*.csproj` folder is located).

By default the name of the _Dockerfile_ which is used is `Dockerfile` and is expected to be within the context path directory. It's possible to explicitly specify the _Dockerfile_ name either as an absolute path or a relative path to the context path.

This is useful if you wish to modify the specific _Dockerfile_ being used when running locally or when the app host is deploying.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var container = builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode
    ? builder.AddDockerfile(
          "mycontainer", "relative/context/path", "Dockerfile.debug")
    : builder.AddDockerfile(
          "mycontainer", "relative/context/path", "Dockerfile.release");
```

## Customize existing container resources

When using <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.AddDockerfile%2A> the return value is an `IResourceBuilder<ContainerResource>`. .NET Aspire includes many custom resource types that are derived from <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource>.

Using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithDockerfile%2A> extension method it's possible to continue using these strongly typed resource types and customize the underlying container that is used.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var pgsql = builder.AddPostgres("pgsql")
                   .WithDockerfile("path/to/context")
                   .WithPgAdmin();
```

## Pass build arguments

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithBuildArg%2A> method can be used to pass arguments into the container image build.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var container = builder.AddDockerfile("mygoapp", "relative/context/path")
                       .WithBuildArg("GO_VERSION", "1.22");
```

The value parameter on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithBuildArg%2A> method can be a literal value (`boolean`, `string`, `int`) or it can be a resource builder for a [parameter resource](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md). The following code replaces the `GO_VERSION` with a parameter value that can be specified at deployment time.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var goVersion = builder.AddParameter("goversion");

var container = builder.AddDockerfile("mygoapp", "relative/context/path")
                       .WithBuildArg("GO_VERSION", goVersion);
```

Build arguments correspond to the [`ARG` command](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/build-args/) in _Dockerfiles_. Expanding the preceding example, this is a multi-stage _Dockerfile_ which specifies specific container image version to use as a parameter.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the Go program
ARG GO_VERSION=1.22
FROM golang:${GO_VERSION} AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY . .
RUN go build mygoapp.go

# Stage 2: Run the Go program
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/base/core:2.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /build/mygoapp .
CMD ["./mygoapp"]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of hardcoding values into the container image, it's recommended to use environment variables for values that frequently change. This avoids the need to rebuild the container image whenever a change is required.

## Pass build secrets

In addition to build arguments it's possible to specify build secrets using <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithBuildSecret%2A> which are made selectively available to individual commands in the _Dockerfile_ using the `--mount=type=secret` syntax on `RUN` commands.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var accessToken = builder.AddParameter("accesstoken", secret: true);

var container = builder.AddDockerfile("myapp", "relative/context/path")
                       .WithBuildSecret("ACCESS_TOKEN", accessToken);
```

For example, consider the `RUN` command in a _Dockerfile_ which exposes the specified secret to the specific command:

```dockerfile
# The helloworld command can read the secret from /run/secrets/ACCESS_TOKEN
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=ACCESS_TOKEN helloworld
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Caution should be exercised when passing secrets in build environments. This is often done when using a token to retrieve dependencies from private repositories or feeds before a build. It is important to ensure that the injected secrets are not copied into the final or intermediate images.

# Custom resource commands in .NET Aspire

Each resource in the .NET Aspire [app model](app-host-overview.md#define-the-app-model) is represented as an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResource> and when added to the [distributed application builder](xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder), it's the generic-type parameter of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1> interface. You use the _resource builder_ API to chain calls, configuring the underlying resource, and in some situations, you might want to add custom commands to the resource. Some common scenario for creating a custom command might be running database migrations or seeding/resetting a database. In this article, you learn how to add a custom command to a Redis resource that clears the cache.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These [.NET Aspire dashboard](dashboard/overview.md) commands are only available when running the dashboard locally. They're not available when running the dashboard in Azure Container Apps.

## Add custom commands to a resource

Start by creating a new .NET Aspire Starter App from the [available templates](aspire-sdk-templates.md). To create the solution from this template, follow the [Quickstart: Build your first .NET Aspire solution](../get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app.md). After creating this solution, add a new class named _RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs_ to the [app host project](app-host-overview.md#app-host-project). Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

:::code source="snippets/custom-commands/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Shares the <xref:Aspire.Hosting> namespace so that it's visible to the app host project.
- Is a `static class` so that it can contain extension methods.
- It defines a single extension method named `WithClearCommand`, extending the `IResourceBuilder<RedisResource>` interface.
- The `WithClearCommand` method registers a command named `clear-cache` that clears the cache of the Redis resource.
- The `WithClearCommand` method returns the `IResourceBuilder<RedisResource>` instance to allow chaining.

The `WithCommand` API adds the appropriate annotations to the resource, which are consumed in the [.NET Aspire dashboard](dashboard/overview.md). The dashboard uses these annotations to render the command in the UI. Before getting too far into those details, let's ensure that you first understand the parameters of the `WithCommand` method:

- `name`: The name of the command to invoke.
- `displayName`: The name of the command to display in the dashboard.
- `executeCommand`: The `Func<ExecuteCommandContext, Task<ExecuteCommandResult>>` to run when the command is invoked, which is where the command logic is implemented.
- `updateState`: The `Func<UpdateCommandStateContext, ResourceCommandState>` callback is invoked to determine the "enabled" state of the command, which is used to enable or disable the command in the dashboard.
- `iconName`: The name of the icon to display in the dashboard. The icon is optional, but when you do provide it, it should be a valid [Fluent UI Blazor icon name](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/Icon#explorer).
- `iconVariant`: The variant of the icon to display in the dashboard, valid options are `Regular` (default) or `Filled`.

## Execute command logic

The `executeCommand` delegate is where the command logic is implemented. This parameter is defined as a `Func<ExecuteCommandContext, Task<ExecuteCommandResult>>`. The `ExecuteCommandContext` provides the following properties:

- `ExecuteCommandContext.ServiceProvider`: The `IServiceProvider` instance that's used to resolve services.
- `ExecuteCommandContext.ResourceName`: The name of the resource instance that the command is being executed on.
- `ExecuteCommandContext.CancellationToken`: The <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> that's used to cancel the command execution.

In the preceding example, the `executeCommand` delegate is implemented as an `async` method that clears the cache of the Redis resource. It delegates out to a private class-scoped function named `OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync` to perform the actual cache clearing. Consider the following code:

```csharp
private static async Task<ExecuteCommandResult> OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync(
    IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> builder,
    ExecuteCommandContext context)
{
    var connectionString = await builder.Resource.GetConnectionStringAsync() ??
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            $"Unable to get the '{context.ResourceName}' connection string.");

    await using var connection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString);

    var database = connection.GetDatabase();

    await database.ExecuteAsync("FLUSHALL");

    return CommandResults.Success();
}
```

The preceding code:

- Retrieves the connection string from the Redis resource.
- Connects to the Redis instance.
- Gets the database instance.
- Executes the `FLUSHALL` command to clear the cache.
- Returns a `CommandResults.Success()` instance to indicate that the command was successful.

## Update command state logic

The `updateState` delegate is where the command state is determined. This parameter is defined as a `Func<UpdateCommandStateContext, ResourceCommandState>`. The `UpdateCommandStateContext` provides the following properties:

- `UpdateCommandStateContext.ServiceProvider`: The `IServiceProvider` instance that's used to resolve services.
- `UpdateCommandStateContext.ResourceSnapshot`: The snapshot of the resource instance that the command is being executed on.

The immutable snapshot is an instance of `CustomResourceSnapshot`, which exposes all sorts of valuable details about the resource instance. Consider the following code:

```csharp
private static ResourceCommandState OnUpdateResourceState(
    UpdateCommandStateContext context)
{
    var logger = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();

    if (logger.IsEnabled(LogLevel.Information))
    {
        logger.LogInformation(
            "Updating resource state: {ResourceSnapshot}",
            context.ResourceSnapshot);
    }

    return context.ResourceSnapshot.HealthStatus is HealthStatus.Healthy
        ? ResourceCommandState.Enabled
        : ResourceCommandState.Disabled;
}
```

The preceding code:

- Retrieves the logger instance from the service provider.
- Logs the resource snapshot details.
- Returns `ResourceCommandState.Enabled` if the resource is healthy; otherwise, it returns `ResourceCommandState.Disabled`.

## Test the custom command

To test the custom command, update your app host project's _Program.cs_ file to include the following code:

:::code source="snippets/custom-commands/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Program.cs" highlight="4":::

The preceding code calls the `WithClearCommand` extension method to add the custom command to the Redis resource. Run the app and navigate to the .NET Aspire dashboard. You should see the custom command listed under the Redis resource. On the **Resources** page of the dashboard, select the ellipsis button under the **Actions** column:

:::image source="media/custom-clear-cache-command.png" lightbox="media/custom-clear-cache-command.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Redis cache resource with custom command displayed.":::

The preceding image shows the **Clear cache** command that was added to the Redis resource. The icon displays as a rabbit crosses out to indicate that the speed of the dependant resource is being cleared.

Select the **Clear cache** command to clear the cache of the Redis resource. The command should execute successfully, and the cache should be cleared:

:::image source="media/custom-clear-cache-command-succeeded.png" lightbox="media/custom-clear-cache-command-succeeded.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Redis cache resource with custom command executed.":::

title: .NET Aspire inner loop networking overview
description: Learn how .NET Aspire handles networking and endpoints, and how you can use them in your app code.
ms.date: 10/29/2024
ms.topic: overview

# .NET Aspire inner-loop networking overview

One of the advantages of developing with .NET Aspire is that it enables you to develop, test, and debug cloud-native apps locally. Inner-loop networking is a key aspect of .NET Aspire that allows your apps to communicate with each other in your development environment. In this article, you learn how .NET Aspire handles various networking scenarios with proxies, endpoints, endpoint configurations, and launch profiles.

## Networking in the inner loop

The inner loop is the process of developing and testing your app locally before deploying it to a target environment. .NET Aspire provides several tools and features to simplify and enhance the networking experience in the inner loop, such as:

- **Launch profiles**: Launch profiles are configuration files that specify how to run your app locally. You can use launch profiles (such as the _launchSettings.json_ file) to define the endpoints, environment variables, and launch settings for your app.
- **Kestrel configuration**: Kestrel configuration allows you to specify the endpoints that the Kestrel web server listens on. You can configure Kestrel endpoints in your app settings, and .NET Aspire automatically uses these settings to create endpoints.
- **Endpoints/Endpoint configurations**: Endpoints are the connections between your app and the services it depends on, such as databases, message queues, or APIs. Endpoints provide information such as the service name, host port, scheme, and environment variable. You can add endpoints to your app either implicitly (via launch profiles) or explicitly by calling <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint%2A>.
- **Proxies**: .NET Aspire automatically launches a proxy for each service binding you add to your app, and assigns a port for the proxy to listen on. The proxy then forwards the requests to the port that your app listens on, which might be different from the proxy port. This way, you can avoid port conflicts and access your app and services using consistent and predictable URLs.

## How endpoints work

A service binding in .NET Aspire involves two integrations: a **service** representing an external resource your app requires (for example, a database, message queue, or API), and a **binding** that establishes a connection between your app and the service and provides necessary information.

.NET Aspire supports two service binding types: **implicit**, automatically created based on specified launch profiles defining app behavior in different environments, and **explicit**, manually created using <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint%2A>.

Upon creating a binding, whether implicit or explicit, .NET Aspire launches a lightweight reverse proxy on a specified port, handling routing and load balancing for requests from your app to the service. The proxy is a .NET Aspire implementation detail, requiring no configuration or management concern.

To help visualize how endpoints work, consider the .NET Aspire starter templates inner-loop networking diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/networking-proxies-1x.png" lightbox="media/networking/networking-proxies.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire Starter Application template inner loop networking diagram.":::

## Launch profiles

When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A>, the app host looks for _Properties/launchSettings.json_ to determine the default set of endpoints. The app host selects a specific launch profile using the following rules:

1. An explicit `launchProfileName` argument passed when calling `AddProject`.
1. The `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE` environment variable. For more information, see [.NET environment variables](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables).
1. The first launch profile defined in _launchSettings.json_.

Consider the following _launchSettings.json_ file:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/networking/Networking.Frontend/Networking.Frontend/Properties/launchSettings.json":::

For the remainder of this article, imagine that you've created an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> assigned to a variable named `builder` with the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder> API:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

To specify the **http** and **https** launch profiles, configure the `applicationUrl` values for both in the _launchSettings.json_ file. These URLs are used to create endpoints for this project. This is the equivalent of:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.WithLaunchProfile.cs" id="verbose":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there's no _launchSettings.json_ (or launch profile), there are no bindings by default.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire and launch profiles](launch-profiles.md).

## Kestrel configured endpoints

.NET Aspire supports Kestrel endpoint configuration. For example, consider an _appsettings.json_ file for a project that defines a Kestrel endpoint with the HTTPS scheme and port 5271:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/networking/Networking.Frontend/Networking.Frontend/appsettings.Development.json" highlight="8-14":::

The preceding configuration specifies an `Https` endpoint. The `Url` property is set to `https://*:5271`, which means the endpoint listens on all interfaces on port 5271. For more information, see [Configure endpoints for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).

With the Kestrel endpoint configured, the project should remove any configured `applicationUrl` from the _launchSettings.json_ file.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `applicationUrl` is present in the _launchSettings.json_ file and the Kestrel endpoint is configured, the app host will throw an exception.

When you add a project resource, there's an overload that lets you specify that the Kestrel endpoint should be used instead of the _launchSettings.json_ file:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.KestrelConfiguration.cs" id="kestrel":::

For more information, see <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A>.

## Ports and proxies

When defining a service binding, the host port is *always* given to the proxy that sits in front of the service. This allows single or multiple replicas of a service to behave similarly. Additionally, all resource dependencies that use the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> API rely of the proxy endpoint from the environment variable.

Consider the following method chain that calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A>, <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithHttpEndpoint%2A>, and then <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReplicas%2A>:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.WithReplicas.cs" id="withreplicas":::

The preceding code results in the following networking diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/proxy-with-replicas-1x.png" lightbox="media/networking/proxy-with-replicas.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire frontend app networking diagram with specific host port and two replicas.":::

The preceding diagram depicts the following:

- A web browser as an entry point to the app.
- A host port of 5066.
- The frontend proxy sitting between the web browser and the frontend service replicas, listening on port 5066.
- The `frontend_0` frontend service replica listening on the randomly assigned port 65001.
- The `frontend_1` frontend service replica listening on the randomly assigned port 65002.

Without the call to `WithReplicas`, there's only one frontend service. The proxy still listens on port 5066, but the frontend service listens on a random port:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.HostPortAndRandomPort.cs" id="hostport":::

There are two ports defined:

- A host port of 5066.
- A random proxy port that the underlying service will be bound to.

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/proxy-host-port-and-random-port-1x.png" lightbox="media/networking/proxy-host-port-and-random-port.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire frontend app networking diagram with specific host port and random port.":::

The preceding diagram depicts the following:

- A web browser as an entry point to the app.
- A host port of 5066.
- The frontend proxy sitting between the web browser and the frontend service, listening on port 5066.
- The frontend service listening on random port of 65001.

The underlying service is fed this port via `ASPNETCORE_URLS` for project resources. Other resources access to this port by specifying an environment variable on the service binding:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.EnvVarPort.cs" id="envvarport":::

The previous code makes the random port available in the `PORT` environment variable. The app uses this port to listen to incoming connections from the proxy. Consider the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/proxy-with-env-var-port-1x.png" lightbox="media/networking/proxy-with-env-var-port.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire frontend app networking diagram with specific host port and environment variable port.":::

The preceding diagram depicts the following:

- A web browser as an entry point to the app.
- A host port of 5067.
- The frontend proxy sitting between the web browser and the frontend service, listening on port 5067.
- The frontend service listening on an environment 65001.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid an endpoint being proxied, set the `IsProxied` property to `false` when calling the `WithEndpoint` extension method. For more information, see [Endpoint extensions: additional considerations](#additional-considerations).

## Omit the host port

When you omit the host port, .NET Aspire generates a random port for both host and service port. This is useful when you want to avoid port conflicts and don't care about the host or service port. Consider the following code:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.OmitHostPort.cs" id="omithostport":::

In this scenario, both the host and service ports are random, as shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/proxy-with-random-ports-1x.png" lightbox="media/networking/proxy-with-random-ports.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire frontend app networking diagram with random host port and proxy port.":::

The preceding diagram depicts the following:

- A web browser as an entry point to the app.
- A random host port of 65000.
- The frontend proxy sitting between the web browser and the frontend service, listening on port 65000.
- The frontend service listening on a random port of 65001.

## Container ports

When you add a container resource, .NET Aspire automatically assigns a random port to the container. To specify a container port, configure the container resource with the desired port:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.ContainerPort.cs" id="containerport":::

The preceding code:

- Creates a container resource named `frontend`, from the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp` image.
- Exposes an `http` endpoint by binding the host to port 8000 and mapping it to the container's port 8080.

Consider the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/networking/proxy-with-docker-port-mapping-1x.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire frontend app networking diagram with a docker host.":::

## Endpoint extension methods

Any resource that implements the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceWithEndpoints> interface can use the `WithEndpoint` extension methods. There are several overloads of this extension, allowing you to specify the scheme, container port, host port, environment variable name, and whether the endpoint is proxied.

There's also an overload that allows you to specify a delegate to configure the endpoint. This is useful when you need to configure the endpoint based on the environment or other factors. Consider the following code:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.WithEndpoint.cs" id="withendpoint":::

The preceding code provides a callback delegate to configure the endpoint. The endpoint is named `admin` and configured to use the `http` scheme and transport, as well as the 17003 host port. The consumer references this endpoint by name, consider the following `AddHttpClient` call:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<WeatherApiClient>(
    client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://_admin.apiservice"));
```

The `Uri` is constructed using the `admin` endpoint name prefixed with the `_` sentinel. This is a convention to indicate that the `admin` segment is the endpoint name belonging to the `apiservice` service. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md).

### Additional considerations

When calling the `WithEndpoint` extension method, the `callback` overload exposes the raw <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.EndpointAnnotation>, which allows the consumer to customize many aspects of the endpoint.

The `AllocatedEndpoint` property allows you to get or set the endpoint for a service. The `IsExternal` and `IsProxied` properties determine how the endpoint is managed and exposed: `IsExternal` decides if it should be publicly accessible, while `IsProxied` ensures DCP manages it, allowing for internal port differences and replication.

> [!TIP]
> If you're hosting an external executable that runs its own proxy and encounters port binding issues due to DCP already binding the port, try setting the `IsProxied` property to `false`. This prevents DCP from managing the proxy, allowing your executable to bind the port successfully.

The `Name` property identifies the service, whereas the `Port` and `TargetPort` properties specify the desired and listening ports, respectively.

For network communication, the `Protocol` property supports **TCP** and **UDP**, with potential for more in the future, and the `Transport` property indicates the transport protocol (**HTTP**, **HTTP2**, **HTTP3**). Lastly, if the service is URI-addressable, the `UriScheme` property provides the URI scheme for constructing the service URI.

For more information, see the available properties of the [EndpointAnnotation properties](/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.endpointannotation#properties).

## Endpoint filtering

All .NET Aspire project resource endpoints follow a set of default heuristics. Some endpoints are included in `ASPNETCORE_URLS` at runtime, some are published as `HTTP/HTTPS_PORTS`, and some configurations are resolved from Kestrel configuration. Regardless of the default behavior, you can filter the endpoints that are included in environment variables by using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpointsInEnvironment%2A> extension method:

:::code source="snippets/networking/Networking.AppHost/Program.EndpointFilter.cs" id="filter":::

The preceding code adds a default HTTPS endpoint, as well as an `admin` endpoint on port 19227. However, the `admin` endpoint is excluded from the environment variables. This is useful when you want to expose an endpoint for internal use only.

title: Eventing in .NET Aspire
description: Learn how to use the .NET eventing features with .NET Aspire.
ms.date: 11/13/2024

# Eventing in .NET Aspire

In .NET Aspire, eventing allows you to publish and subscribe to events during various [app host life cycles](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#app-host-life-cycles). Eventing is more flexible than life cycle events. Both let you run arbitrary code during event callbacks, but eventing offers finer control of event timing, publishing, and provides supports for custom events.

The eventing mechanisms in .NET Aspire are part of the [📦 Aspire.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting) NuGet package. This package provides a set of interfaces and classes in the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing> namespace that you use to publish and subscribe to events in your .NET Aspire app host project. Eventing is scoped to the app host itself and the resources within.

In this article, you learn how to use the eventing features in .NET Aspire.

## App host eventing

The following events are available in the app host and occur in the following order:

1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.BeforeStartEvent>: This event is raised before the app host starts.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AfterEndpointsAllocatedEvent>: This event is raised after the app host allocated endpoints.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AfterResourcesCreatedEvent>: This event is raised after the app host created resources.

All of the preceding events are analogous to the [app host life cycles](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#app-host-life-cycles). That is, an implementation of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> could handle these events just the same. With the eventing API, however, you can run arbitrary code when these events are raised and event define custom events—any event that implements the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEvent> interface.

### Subscribe to app host events

To subscribe to the built-in app host events, use the eventing API. After you have a distributed application builder instance, walk up to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.Eventing?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.Subscribe``1(System.Func{``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken,System.Threading.Tasks.Task})> API. Consider the following sample app host _Program.cs_ file:

:::code source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Program.cs" highlight="17-25,27-35,37-45":::

The preceding code is based on the starter template with the addition of the calls to the `Subscribe` API. The `Subscribe<T>` API returns a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.DistributedApplicationEventSubscription> instance that you can use to unsubscribe from the event. It's common to discard the returned subscriptions, as you don't usually need to unsubscribe from events as the entire app is torn down when the app host is shut down.

When the app host is run, by the time the .NET Aspire dashboard is displayed, you should see the following log output in the console:

:::code language="Plaintext" source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Console.txt" highlight="2,10,16":::

The log output confirms that event handlers are executed in the order of the app host life cycle events. The subscription order doesn't affect execution order. The `BeforeStartEvent` is triggered first, followed by `AfterEndpointsAllocatedEvent`, and finally `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent`.

## Resource eventing

In addition to the app host events, you can also subscribe to resource events. Resource events are raised specific to an individual resource. Resource events are defined as implementations of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationResourceEvent> interface. The following resource events are available in the listed order:

1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ConnectionStringAvailableEvent>: Raised when a connection string becomes available for a resource.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.BeforeResourceStartedEvent>: Raised before the orchestrator starts a new resource.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceReadyEvent>: Raised when a resource initially transitions to a ready state.

### Subscribe to resource events

To subscribe to resource events, use the eventing API. After you have a distributed application builder instance, walk up to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.Eventing?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.Subscribe``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResource,System.Func{``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken,System.Threading.Tasks.Task})> API. Consider the following sample app host _Program.cs_ file:

:::code source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.ResourceAppHost/Program.cs" highlight="8-17,19-28,30-39":::

The preceding code subscribes to the `ResourceReadyEvent`, `ConnectionStringAvailableEvent`, and `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` events on the `cache` resource. When <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedis*> is called, it returns an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1> where `T` is a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.RedisResource>. The resource builder exposes the resource as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1.Resource?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. The resource in question is then passed to the `Subscribe` API to subscribe to the events on the resource.

When the app host is run, by the time the .NET Aspire dashboard is displayed, you should see the following log output in the console:

:::code language="Plaintext" source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.ResourceAppHost/Console.txt" highlight="8,10,12":::

> [!NOTE]
> Some events are blocking. For example, when the `BeforeResourceStartEvent` is published, the startup of the resource will be blocked until all subscriptions for that event on a given resource have completed executing. Whether an event is blocking or not depends on how it is published (see the following section).

## Publish events

When subscribing to any of the built-in events, you don't need to publish the event yourself as the app host orchestrator manages to publish built-in events on your behalf. However, you can publish custom events with the eventing API. To publish an event, you have to first define an event as an implementation of either the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEvent> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationResourceEvent> interface. You need to determine which interface to implement based on whether the event is a global app host event or a resource-specific event.

Then, you can subscribe and publish the event by calling the either of the following APIs:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync``1(``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken)>: Publishes an event to all subscribes of the specific event type.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync``1(``0,Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior,System.Threading.CancellationToken)>: Publishes an event to all subscribes of the specific event type with a specified dispatch behavior.

### Provide an `EventDispatchBehavior`

When events are dispatched, you can control how the events are dispatched to subscribers. The event dispatch behavior is specified with the `EventDispatchBehavior` enum. The following behaviors are available:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingSequential?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events sequentially and blocks until they're all processed.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingConcurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events concurrently and blocks until they are all processed.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlockingSequential?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events sequentially but doesn't block.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlockingConcurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events concurrently but doesn't block.

The default behavior is `EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingSequential`. To override this behavior, when calling a publishing API such as <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync*>, provide the desired behavior as an argument.

title: Persist data with .NET Aspire using volume mounts
description: Learn about .NET Aspire volume configurations.
ms.date: 04/26/2024
ms.topic: how-to

# Persist .NET Aspire project data using volumes

In this article, you learn how to configure .NET Aspire projects to persist data across app launches using volumes. A continuous set of data during local development is useful in many scenarios. Various .NET Aspire resource container types are able to leverage volume storage, such as PostgreSQL, Redis and Azure Storage.

## When to use volumes

By default, every time you start and stop a .NET Aspire project, the app also creates and destroys the app resource containers. This setup creates problems when you want to persist data in a database or storage services between app launches for testing or debugging. For example, you may want to handle the following scenarios:

- Work with a continuous set of data in a database during an extended development session.
- Test or debug a changing set of files in an Azure Blob Storage emulator.
- Maintain cached data or messages in a Redis instance across app launches.

These goals can all be accomplished using volumes. With volumes, you decide which services retain data between launches of your .NET Aspire project.

## Understand volumes

Volumes are the recommended way to persist data generated by containers and supported on both Windows and Linux. Volumes can store data from multiple containers at a time, offer high performance and are easy to back up or migrate. With .NET Aspire, you configure a volume for each resource container using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.WithBindMount%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which accepts three parameters:

- **Source**: The source path of the volume, which is the physical location on the host.
- **Target**: The target path in the container of the data you want to persist.

For the remainder of this article, imagine that your exploring a `Program` class in a .NET Aspire [app host project](app-host-overview.md) that's already defined the distributed app builder bits:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// TODO:
//   Consider various code snippets for configuring 
//   volumes here and persistent passwords.

builder.Build().Run();
```

The first code snippet to consider uses the `WithBindMount` API to configure a volume for a SQL Server resource. The following code demonstrates how to configure a volume for a SQL Server resource in a .NET Aspire app host project:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/volumes/VolumeMounts.AppHost/Program.WithBindMount.cs" id="mount":::

In this example:

- `VolumeMount.AppHost-sql-data` sets where the volume will be stored on the host.
- `/var/opt/mssql` sets the path to the database files in the container.

All .NET Aspire container resources can utilize volume mounts, and some provide convenient APIs for adding named volumes derived from resources. Using the `WithDataVolume` as an example, the following code is functionally equivalent to the previous example but more succinct:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/volumes/VolumeMounts.AppHost/Program.Implicit.cs" id="implicit":::

With the app host project being named `VolumeMount.AppHost`, the `WithDataVolume` method automatically creates a named volume as `VolumeMount.AppHost-sql-data` and is mounted to the `/var/opt/mssql` path in the SQL Server container. The naming convention is as follows:

- `{appHostProjectName}-{resourceName}-data`: The volume name is derived from the app host project name and the resource name.

## Create a persistent password

Named volumes require a consistent password between app launches. .NET Aspire conveniently provides random password generation functionality. Consider the previous example once more, where a password is generated automatically:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/volumes/VolumeMounts.AppHost/Program.Implicit.cs" id="implicit":::

Since the `password` parameter isn't provided when calling `AddSqlServer`, .NET Aspire automatically generates a password for the SQL Server resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This isn't a persistent password! Instead, it changes every time the app host runs.

To create a _persistent_ password, you must override the generated password. To do this, run the following command in your app host project directory to set a local password in your .NET user secrets:

```dotnetcli
dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:sql-password <password>
```

The naming convention for these secrets is important to understand. The password is stored in configuration with the `Parameters:sql-password` key. The naming convention follows this pattern:

- `Parameters:{resourceName}-password`: In the case of the SQL Server resource (which was named `"sql"`), the password is stored in the configuration with the key `Parameters:sql-password`.

The same pattern applies to the other server-based resource types, such as those shown in the following table:

| Resource type | Hosting package | Example resource name | Override key |
|--|--|--|
| MySQL | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.MySql) | `mysql` | `Parameters:mysql-password` |
| Oracle | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Oracle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Oracle) | `oracle` | `Parameters:oracle-password` |
| PostgreSQL | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL) | `postgresql` | `Parameters:postgresql-password` |
| RabbitMQ | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMq) | `rabbitmq` | `Parameters:rabbitmq-password` |
| SQL Server | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer) | `sql` | `Parameters:sql-password` |

By overriding the generated password, you can ensure that the password remains consistent between app launches, thus creating a persistent password. An alternative approach is to use the `AddParameter` method to create a parameter that can be used as a password. The following code demonstrates how to create a persistent password for a SQL Server resource:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/volumes/VolumeMounts.AppHost/Program.ExplicitStable.cs" id="explicit":::

The preceding code snippet demonstrates how to create a persistent password for a SQL Server resource. The `AddParameter` method is used to create a parameter named `sql-password` that's considered a secret. The `AddSqlServer` method is then called with the `password` parameter to set the password for the SQL Server resource. For more information, see [External parameters](external-parameters.md).

## Next steps

You can apply the volume concepts in the preceding code to a variety of services, including seeding a database with data that will persist across app launches. Try combining these techniques with the resource implementations demonstrated in the following tutorials:

- [Tutorial: Connect an ASP.NET Core app to .NET Aspire storage integrations](../storage/azure-storage-integrations.md)
- [Tutorial: Connect an ASP.NET Core app to SQL Server using .NET Aspire and Entity Framework Core](../database/sql-server-integrations.md)

title: External parameters
description: Learn how to express parameters such as secrets, connection strings, and other configuration values that might vary between environments.
ms.topic: how-to
ms.date: 12/06/2024
---

# External parameters

Environments provide context for the application to run in. Parameters express the ability to ask for an external value when running the app. Parameters can be used to provide values to the app when running locally, or to prompt for values when deploying. They can be used to model a wide range of scenarios including secrets, connection strings, and other configuration values that might vary between environments.

## Parameter values

Parameter values are read from the `Parameters` section of the app host's configuration and are used to provide values to the app while running locally. When you publish the app, if the value isn't configured you're prompted to provide it.

Consider the following example app host _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add a parameter named "value"
var value = builder.AddParameter("value");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")
       .WithEnvironment("EXAMPLE_VALUE", value);
```

The preceding code adds a parameter named `value` to the app host. The parameter is then passed to the `Projects.ApiService` project as an environment variable named `EXAMPLE_VALUE`.

### Configure parameter values

Adding parameters to the builder is only one aspect of the configuration. You must also provide the value for the parameter. The value can be provided in the app host configuration file, set as a user secret, or configured in any [other standard configuration](/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration). When parameter values aren't found, they're prompted for when publishing the app.

Consider the following app host configuration file _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_:

```json
{
    "Parameters": {
        "value": "local-value"
    }
}
```

The preceding JSON configures a parameter in the `Parameters` section of the app host configuration. In other words, that app host is able to find the parameter as its configured. For example, you could walk up to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.Configuration?displayProperty=nameWithType> and access the value using the `Parameters:value` key:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var key = $"Parameters:value";
var value = builder.Configuration[key]; // value = "local-value"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> However, you don't need to access this configuration value yourself in the app host. Instead, the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource> is used to pass the parameter value to dependent resources. Most often as an environment variable.

### Parameter representation in the manifest

.NET Aspire uses a [deployment manifest](../deployment/manifest-format.md) to represent the app's resources and their relationships. Parameters are represented in the manifest as a new primitive called `parameter.v0`:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "value": {
      "type": "parameter.v0",
      "value": "{value.inputs.value}",
      "inputs": {
        "value": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Secret values

Parameters can be used to model secrets. When a parameter is marked as a secret, it serves as a hint to the manifest that the value should be treated as a secret. When you publish the app, the value is prompted for and stored in a secure location. When you run the app locally, the value is read from the `Parameters` section of the app host configuration.

Consider the following example app host _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add a secret parameter named "secret"
var secret = builder.AddParameter("secret", secret: true);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")
       .WithEnvironment("SECRET", secret);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Now consider the following app host configuration file _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_:

```json
{
    "Parameters": {
        "secret": "local-secret"
    }
}
```

The manifest representation is as follows:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "value": {
      "type": "parameter.v0",
      "value": "{value.inputs.value}",
      "inputs": {
        "value": {
          "type": "string",
          "secret": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Connection string values

Parameters can be used to model connection strings. When you publish the app, the value is prompted for and stored in a secure location. When you run the app locally, the value is read from the `ConnectionStrings` section of the app host configuration.

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

Consider the following example app host _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddConnectionString("redis");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApplication>("api")
       .WithReference(redis);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Now consider the following app host configuration file _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_:

```json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "redis": "local-connection-string"
    }
}
```

For more information pertaining to connection strings and their representation in the deployment manifest, see [Connection string and binding references](../deployment/manifest-format.md#connection-string-and-binding-references).

## Parameter example

To express a parameter, consider the following example code:

:::code source="snippets/params/Parameters.AppHost/Program.cs":::

The following steps are performed:

- Adds a SQL Server resource named `sql` and publishes it as a connection string.
- Adds a database named `db`.
- Adds a parameter named `insertionRows`.
- Adds a project named `api` and associates it with the `Projects.Parameters_ApiService` project resource type-parameter.
- Passes the `insertionRows` parameter to the `api` project.
- References the `db` database.

The value for the `insertionRows` parameter is read from the `Parameters` section of the app host configuration file _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/params/Parameters.AppHost/appsettings.json":::

The `Parameters_ApiService` project consumes the `insertionRows` parameter. Consider the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ example file:

:::code source="snippets/params/Parameters.ApiService/Program.cs":::

# .NET Aspire testing overview

.NET Aspire supports automated testing of your application through the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Testing) NuGet package. This package provides the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder> class, which is used to create a test host for your application. The testing builder launches your app host project in a background thread and manages its lifecycle, allowing you to control and manipulate the application and its resources through <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication> instances.

By default, the testing builder disables the dashboard and randomizes the ports of proxied resources to enable multiple instances of your application to run concurrently. Once your test completes, disposing of the application or testing builder cleans up your app resources.

To get started writing your first integration test with .NET Aspire, see the [Write your first .NET Aspire test](./write-your-first-test.md) article.

## Testing .NET Aspire solutions

.NET Aspire's testing capabilities are designed specifically for closed-box integration testing of your entire distributed application. Unlike unit tests or open-box integration tests, which typically run individual components in isolation, .NET Aspire tests launch your complete solution (the app host and all its resources) as separate processes, closely simulating real-world scenarios.

Consider the following diagram that shows how the .NET Aspire testing project starts the app host, which then starts the application and its resources:

:::image type="content" source="media/testing-diagram-thumb.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire testing diagram" lightbox="media/testing-diagram.png":::

1. The **test project** starts the app host.
1. The **app host** process starts.
1. The **app host** runs the `Database`, `API`, and `Frontend` applications.
1. The **test project** sends an HTTP request to the `Frontend` application.

The diagram illustrates that the **test project** starts the app host, which then orchestrates the all dependent app resources—regardless of their type. The test project is able to send an HTTP request to the `Frontend` app, which depends on an `API` app, and the `API` app depends on a `Database`. A successful request confirms that the `Frontend` app can communicate with the `API` app, and that the `API` app can successfully get data from the `Database`. For more information on seeing this approach in action, see the [Write your first .NET Aspire test](write-your-first-test.md) article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET Aspire testing doesn't enable scenarios for mocking, substituting, or replacing services in dependency injection—as the tests run in a separate process.

Use .NET Aspire testing when you want to:

- Verify end-to-end functionality of your distributed application.
- Ensure interactions between multiple services and resources (such as databases) behave correctly in realistic conditions.
- Confirm data persistence and integration with real external dependencies, like a PostgreSQL database.

If your goal is to test a single project in isolation, run components in-memory, or mock external dependencies, consider using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory%601> instead.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Aspire tests run your application as separate processes, meaning you don't have direct access to internal services or components from your test code. You can influence application behavior through environment variables or configuration settings, but internal state and services remain encapsulated within their respective processes.

## Disable port randomization

By default, .NET Aspire uses random ports to allow multiple instances of your application to run concurrently without interference. It uses [.NET Aspire's service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) to ensure applications can locate each other's endpoints. To disable port randomization, pass `"DcpPublisher:RandomizePorts=false"` when constructing your testing builder, as shown in the following snippet:

```csharp
var builder = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
    .CreateAsync<Projects.MyAppHost>(
        [
            "DcpPublisher:RandomizePorts=false"
        ]);
```

## Enable the dashboard

The testing builder disables the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) by default. To enable it, you can set the `DisableDashboard` property to `false`, when creating your testing builder as shown in the following snippet:

```csharp
var builder = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
    .CreateAsync<Projects.MyAppHost>(
        args: [],
        configureBuilder: (appOptions, hostSettings) =>
        {
            appOptions.DisableDashboard = false;
        });
```

# Write your first .NET Aspire test

In this article, you learn how to create a test project, write tests, and run them for your .NET Aspire solutions. The tests in this article aren't unit tests, but rather functional or integration tests. .NET Aspire includes several variations of [testing project templates](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md#net-aspire-templates) that you can use to test your .NET Aspire resource dependencies—and their communications. The testing project templates are available for MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit testing frameworks and include a sample test that you can use as a starting point for your tests.

The .NET Aspire test project templates rely on the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Testing) NuGet package. This package exposes the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder> class, which is used to create a test host for your distributed application. The distributed application testing builder launches your app host project with instrumentation hooks so that you can access and manipulate the host at various stages of its lifecyle. In particular, <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder> provides you access to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication> class to create and start the [app host](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md).

## Create a test project

The easiest way to create a .NET Aspire test project is to use the testing project template. If you're starting a new .NET Aspire project and want to include test projects, the [Visual Studio tooling supports that option](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md#create-test-project). If you're adding a test project to an existing .NET Aspire project, you can use the `dotnet new` command to create a test project:

:::zone pivot="xunit"

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire-xunit
```

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="mstest"

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire-mstest
```

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="nunit"

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire-nunit
```

:::zone-end

For more information, see the .NET CLI [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command documentation.

## Explore the test project

The following example test project was created as part of the **.NET Aspire Starter Application** template. If you're unfamiliar with it, see [Quickstart: Build your first .NET Aspire project](../get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app.md). The .NET Aspire test project takes a project reference dependency on the target app host. Consider the template project:

:::zone pivot="xunit"

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/testing/xunit/AspireApp.Tests/AspireApp.Tests.csproj":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="mstest"

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/testing/mstest/AspireApp.Tests/AspireApp.Tests.csproj":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="nunit"

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/testing/nunit/AspireApp.Tests/AspireApp.Tests.csproj":::

:::zone-end

The preceding project file is fairly standard. There's a `PackageReference` to the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Testing) NuGet package, which includes the required types to write tests for .NET Aspire projects.

The template test project includes a `IntegrationTest1` class with a single test. The test verifies the following scenario:

- The app host is successfully created and started.
- The `webfrontend` resource is available and running.
- An HTTP request can be made to the `webfrontend` resource and returns a successful response (HTTP 200 OK).

Consider the following test class:

:::zone pivot="xunit"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/xunit/AspireApp.Tests/IntegrationTest1.cs":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="mstest"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/mstest/AspireApp.Tests/IntegrationTest1.cs":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="nunit"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/nunit/AspireApp.Tests/IntegrationTest1.cs":::

:::zone-end

The preceding code:

- Relies on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> API to asynchronously create the app host.
  - The `appHost` is an instance of `IDistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` that represents the app host.
  - The `appHost` instance has its service collection configured with the standard HTTP resilience handler. For more information, see [Build resilient HTTP apps: Key development patterns](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience).
- The `appHost` has its <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.IDistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.BuildAsync(System.Threading.CancellationToken)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method invoked, which returns the `DistributedApplication` instance as the `app`.
  - The `app` has its service provider get the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService> instance.
  - The `app` is started asynchronously.
- An <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is created for the `webfrontend` resource by calling `app.CreateHttpClient`.
- The `resourceNotificationService` is used to wait for the `webfrontend` resource to be available and running.
- A simple HTTP GET request is made to the root of the `webfrontend` resource.
- The test asserts that the response status code is `OK`.

## Test resource environment variables

To further test resources and their expressed dependencies in your .NET Aspire solution, you can assert that environment variables are injected correctly. The following example demonstrates how to test that the `webfrontend` resource has an HTTPS environment variable that resolves to the `apiservice` resource:

:::zone pivot="xunit"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/xunit/AspireApp.Tests/EnvVarTests.cs":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="mstest"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/mstest/AspireApp.Tests/EnvVarTests.cs":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="nunit"

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/testing/nunit/AspireApp.Tests/EnvVarTests.cs":::

:::zone-end

The preceding code:

- Relies on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> API to asynchronously create the app host.
- The `builder` instance is used to retrieve an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceWithEnvironment> instance named "webfrontend" from the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.IDistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.Resources%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- The `webfrontend` resource is used to call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceExtensions.GetEnvironmentVariableValuesAsync%2A> to retrieve its configured environment variables.
- The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationOperation.Publish?displayProperty=nameWithType> argument is passed when calling `GetEnvironmentVariableValuesAsync` to specify environment variables that are published to the resource as binding expressions.
- With the returned environment variables, the test asserts that the `webfrontend` resource has an HTTPS environment variable that resolves to the `apiservice` resource.

## Summary

The .NET Aspire testing project template makes it easier to create test projects for .NET Aspire solutions. The template project includes a sample test that you can use as a starting point for your tests. The `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` follows a familiar pattern to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory`1> in ASP.NET Core. It allows you to create a test host for your distributed application and run tests against it.

Finally, when using the `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` all resource logs are redirected to the `DistributedApplication` by default. The redirection of resource logs enables scenarios where you want to assert that a resource is logging correctly.

# Manage the app host in .NET Aspire tests

When writing functional or integration tests with .NET Aspire, managing the [app host](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md) instance efficiently is crucial. The app host represents the full application environment and can be costly to create and tear down. This article explains how to manage the app host instance in your .NET Aspire tests.

For writing tests with .NET Aspire, you use the [📦 `Aspire.Hosting.Testing`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Testing) NuGet package which contains some helper classes to manage the app host instance in your tests.

## Use the `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` class

In the [tutorial on writing your first test](./write-your-first-test.md), you were introduced to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder> class which can be used to create the app host instance:

```csharp
var appHost = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
    .CreateAsync<Projects.AspireApp_AppHost>();
```

The `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync<T>` method takes the app host project type as a generic parameter to create the app host instance. While this method is executed at the start of each test, it's more efficient to create the app host instance once and share it across tests as the test suite grows.

:::zone pivot="xunit"

With xUnit, you implement the [IAsyncLifetime](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/master/src/xunit.core/IAsyncLifetime.cs) interface on the test class to support asynchronous initialization and disposal of the app host instance. The `InitializeAsync` method is used to create the app host instance before the tests are run and the `DisposeAsync` method disposes the app host once the tests are completed.

```csharp
public class WebTests : IAsyncLifetime
{
    private DistributedApplication _app;

    public async Task InitializeAsync()
    {
        var appHost = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
            .CreateAsync<Projects.AspireApp_AppHost>();

        _app = await appHost.BuildAsync();
    }

    public async Task DisposeAsync() => await _app.DisposeAsync();

    [Fact]
    public async Task GetWebResourceRootReturnsOkStatusCode()
    {
        // test code here
    }
}
```

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="mstest"

With MSTest, you use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.ClassInitializeAttribute> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.ClassCleanupAttribute> on static methods of the test class to provide the initialization and cleanup of the app host instance. The `ClassInitialize` method is used to create the app host instance before the tests are run and the `ClassCleanup` method disposes the app host instance once the tests are completed.

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class WebTests
{
    private static DistributedApplication _app;

    [ClassInitialize]
    public static async Task ClassInitialize(TestContext context)
    {
       var appHost = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
            .CreateAsync<Projects.AspireApp_AppHost>();

        _app = await appHost.BuildAsync();
    }
    
    [ClassCleanup]
    public static async Task ClassCleanup() => await _app.DisposeAsync();

    [TestMethod]
    public async Task GetWebResourceRootReturnsOkStatusCode()
    {
        // test code here
    }
}
```

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="nunit"

With NUnit, you use the [OneTimeSetUp](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/onetimesetup.html) and [OneTimeTearDown](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/onetimeteardown.html) attributes on methods of the test class to provide the setup and teardown of the app host instance. The `OneTimeSetUp` method is used to create the app host instance before the tests are run and the `OneTimeTearDown` method disposes the app host instance once the tests are completed.

```csharp
public class WebTests
{
    private DistributedApplication _app;

    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public async Task OneTimeSetup()
    {
       var appHost = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
            .CreateAsync<Projects.AspireApp_AppHost>();

        _app = await appHost.BuildAsync();
    }
    
    [OneTimeTearDown]
    public async Task OneTimeTearDown() => await _app.DisposeAsync();

    [Test]
    public async Task GetWebResourceRootReturnsOkStatusCode()
    {
        // test code here
    }
}
```

:::zone-end

By capturing the app host in a field when the test run is started, you can access it in each test without the need to recreate it, decreasing the time it takes to run the tests. Then, when the test run completes, the app host is disposed, which cleans up any resources that were created during the test run, such as containers.

## Pass arguments to your app host

You can access the arguments from your app host with the `args` parameter. Arguments are also passed to [.NET's configuration system](/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration), so you can override many configuration settings this way. In the following example, you override the [environment](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments) by specifying it as a command line option:

```csharp
var builder = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
    .CreateAsync<Projects.MyAppHost>(
    [
        "--environment=Testing"
    ]);
```

Other arguments can be passed to your app host `Program` and made available in your app host. In the next example, you pass an argument to the app host and use it to control whether you add data volumes to a Postgres instance.

In the app host `Program`, you use configuration to support enabling or disabling volumes:

```csharp
var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres1");
if (builder.Configuration.GetValue("UseVolumes", true))
{
    postgres.WithDataVolume();
}
```

In test code, you pass `"UseVolumes=false"` in the `args` to the app host:

```csharp
public async Task DisableVolumesFromTest()
{
    // Disable volumes in the test builder via arguments:
    using var builder = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
        .CreateAsync<Projects.TestingAppHost1_AppHost>(
        [
            "UseVolumes=false"
        ]);

    // The container will have no volume annotation since we disabled volumes by passing UseVolumes=false
    var postgres = builder.Resources.Single(r => r.Name == "postgres1");

    Assert.Empty(postgres.Annotations.OfType<ContainerMountAnnotation>());
}
```

## Use the `DistributedApplicationFactory` class

While the `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` class is useful for many scenarios, there might be situations where you want more control over starting the app host, such as executing code before the builder is created or after the app host is built. In these cases, you implement your own version of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationFactory> class. This is what the `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` uses internally.

```csharp
public class TestingAspireAppHost()
    : DistributedApplicationFactory(typeof(Projects.AspireApp_AppHost))
{
    // override methods here
}
```

The constructor requires the type of the app host project reference as a parameter. Optionally, you can provide arguments to the underlying host application builder. These arguments control how the app host starts and provide values to the args variable used by the _Program.cs_ file to start the app host instance.

### Lifecycle methods

The `DistributionApplicationFactory` class provides several lifecycle methods that can be overridden to provide custom behavior throughout the preparation and creation of the app host. The available methods are `OnBuilderCreating`, `OnBuilderCreated`, `OnBuilding`, and `OnBuilt`.

For example, we can use the `OnBuilderCreating` method to set configuration, such as the subscription and resource group information for Azure, before the app host is created and any dependent Azure resources are provisioned, resulting in our tests using the correct Azure environment.

```csharp
public class TestingAspireAppHost() : DistributedApplicationFactory(typeof(Projects.AspireApp_AppHost))
{
    protected override void OnBuilderCreating(DistributedApplicationOptions applicationOptions, HostApplicationBuilderSettings hostOptions)
    {
        hostOptions.Configuration ??= new();
        hostOptions.Configuration["environment"] = "Development";
        hostOptions.Configuration["AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"] = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";
        hostOptions.Configuration["AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP"] = "my-resource-group";
    }
}
```

Because of the order of precedence in the .NET configuration system, the environment variables will be used over anything in the _appsettings.json_ or _secrets.json_ file.

Another scenario you might want to use in the lifecycle is to configure the services used by the app host. In the following example, consider a scenario where you override the `OnBuilderCreated` API to add resilience to the `HttpClient`:

```csharp
protected override void OnBuilderCreated(
    DistributedApplicationBuilder applicationBuilder)
{
    applicationBuilder.Services.ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(clientBuilder =>
    {
        clientBuilder.AddStandardResilienceHandler();
    });
}
```

# Access resources in .NET Aspire tests

In this article, you learn how to access the resources from the .NET Aspire app host in your tests. The app host represents the full application environment and contains all the resources that are available to the application. When writing functional or integration tests with .NET Aspire, you might need to access these resources to verify the behavior of your application.

## Access HTTP resources

To access an HTTP resource, use the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> to request and receive responses. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication> and the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationFactory> both provide a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Testing.DistributedApplicationFactory.CreateHttpClient*> method that's used to create an `HttpClient` instance for a specific resource, based on the resource name from the app host. This method also takes an optional `endpointName` parameter, so if the resource has multiple endpoints, you can specify which one to use.

## Access other resources

In a test, you might want to access other resources by the connection information they provide, for example, querying a database to verify the state of the data. For this, you use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationExtensions.GetConnectionString*?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to retrieve the connection string for a resource, and then provide that to a client library within the test to interact with the resource.

## Ensure resources are available

Starting with .NET Aspire 9, there's support for waiting on dependent resources to be available (via the [health check](../fundamentals/health-checks.md) mechanism). This is useful in tests that ensure a resource is available before attempting to access it. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService> class provides a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService.WaitForResourceAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> method that's used to wait for a named resource to be available. This method takes the resource name and the desired state of the resource as parameters and returns a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> that yields back when the resource is available. You can access the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService> via <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.ResourceNotifications?displayProperty=nameWithType>, as in the following example.

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to provide a time-out when waiting for resources, to prevent the test from hanging indefinitely in situations where a resource never becomes available.

```csharp
using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
await app.ResourceNotifications.WaitForResourceAsync(
    "webfrontend",  
    KnownResourceStates.Running,
    cts.Token); 
```

A resource enters the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.KnownResourceStates.Running?displayProperty=nameWithType> state as soon as it starts executing, but this doesn't mean that it's ready to serve requests. If you want to wait for the resource to be ready to serve requests, and your resource has health checks, you can wait for the resource to become healthy by using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService.WaitForResourceHealthyAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

```csharp
using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

await app.ResourceNotifications.WaitForResourceHealthyAsync(
    "webfrontend",
    cts.Token);
```

This resource-notification pattern ensures that the resources are available before running the tests, avoiding potential issues with the tests failing due to the resources not being ready.

description: Understand essential service discovery concepts in .NET Aspire.
ms.date: 04/10/2024
ms.topic: quickstart

# .NET Aspire service discovery

In this article, you learn how service discovery works within a .NET Aspire project. .NET Aspire includes functionality for configuring service discovery at development and testing time. Service discovery functionality works by providing configuration in the format expected by the _configuration-based endpoint resolver_ from the .NET Aspire AppHost project to the individual service projects added to the application model. For more information, see [Service discovery in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/service-discovery).

## Implicit service discovery by reference

Configuration for service discovery is only added for services that are referenced by a given project. For example, consider the following AppHost program:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalog = builder.AddProject<Projects.CatalogService>("catalog");
var basket = builder.AddProject<Projects.BasketService>("basket");

var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyFrontend>("frontend")
                      .WithReference(basket)
                      .WithReference(catalog);
```

In the preceding example, the _frontend_ project references the _catalog_ project and the _basket_ project. The two <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> calls instruct the .NET Aspire project to pass service discovery information for the referenced projects (_catalog_, and _basket_) into the _frontend_ project.

## Named endpoints

Some services expose multiple, named endpoints. Named endpoints can be resolved by specifying the endpoint name in the host portion of the HTTP request URI, following the format `scheme://_endpointName.serviceName`. For example, if a service named "basket" exposes an endpoint named "dashboard", then the URI `https+http://_dashboard.basket` can be used to specify this endpoint, for example:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://basket"));

builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceDashboardClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://_dashboard.basket"));
```

In the preceding example, two <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> classes are added, one for the core basket service and one for the basket service's dashboard.

### Named endpoints using configuration

With the configuration-based endpoint resolver, named endpoints can be specified in configuration by prefixing the endpoint value with `_endpointName.`, where `endpointName` is the endpoint name. For example, consider this _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ configuration which defined a default endpoint (with no name) and an endpoint named "dashboard":

```json
{
  "Services": {
    "basket":
      "https": "https://10.2.3.4:8080", /* the https endpoint, requested via https://basket */
      "dashboard": "https://10.2.3.4:9999" /* the "dashboard" endpoint, requested via https://_dashboard.basket */
    }
  }
}
```

In the preceding JSON:

- The default endpoint, when resolving `https://basket` is `10.2.3.4:8080`.
- The "dashboard" endpoint, resolved via `https://_dashboard.basket` is `10.2.3.4:9999`.

### Named endpoints in .NET Aspire

```csharp
var basket = builder.AddProject<Projects.BasketService>("basket")
    .WithHttpsEndpoint(hostPort: 9999, name: "dashboard");
```

### Named endpoints in Kubernetes using DNS SRV

When deploying to [Kubernetes](../deployment/overview.md#deploy-to-kubernetes), the DNS SRV service endpoint resolver can be used to resolve named endpoints. For example, the following resource definition will result in a DNS SRV record being created for an endpoint named "default" and an endpoint named "dashboard", both on the service named "basket".

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: basket
spec:
  selector:
    name: basket-service
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - name: default
    port: 8080
  - name: dashboard
    port: 9999
```

To configure a service to resolve the "dashboard" endpoint on the "basket" service, add the DNS SRV service endpoint resolver to the host builder as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddServiceDiscoveryCore();
builder.Services.AddDnsSrvServiceEndpointProvider();
```

For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceDiscoveryServiceCollectionExtensions.AddServiceDiscoveryCore%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.ServiceDiscoveryDnsServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDnsSrvServiceEndpointProvider%2A>.

The special port name "default" is used to specify the default endpoint, resolved using the URI `https://basket`.

As in the previous example, add service discovery to an `HttpClient` for the basket service:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https://basket"));
```

Similarly, the "dashboard" endpoint can be targeted as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceDashboardClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https://_dashboard.basket"));
```

# .NET Aspire service defaults

In this article, you learn about the .NET Aspire service defaults project, a set of extension methods that:

- Connect [telemetry](telemetry.md), [health checks](health-checks.md), [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) to your app.
- Are customizable and extensible.

Cloud-native applications often require extensive configurations to ensure they work across different environments reliably and securely. .NET Aspire provides many helper methods and tools to streamline the management of configurations for OpenTelemetry, health checks, environment variables, and more.

## Explore the service defaults project

When you either [**Enlist in .NET Aspire orchestration**](setup-tooling.md#enlist-in-orchestration) or [create a new .NET Aspire project](../get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app.md), the _YourAppName.ServiceDefaults.csproj_ project is added to your solution. For example, when building an API, you call the `AddServiceDefaults` method in the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your apps:

```csharp
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
```

The `AddServiceDefaults` method handles the following tasks:

- Configures OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing.
- Adds default health check endpoints.
- Adds service discovery functionality.
- Configures <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> to work with service discovery.

For more information, see [Provided extension methods](#provided-extension-methods) for details on the `AddServiceDefaults` method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The .NET Aspire service defaults project is specifically designed for sharing the _Extensions.cs_ file and its functionality. Don't include other shared functionality or models in this project. Use a conventional shared class library project for those purposes.

## Project characteristics

The _YourAppName.ServiceDefaults_ project is a .NET 9.0 library that contains the following XML:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/template/YourAppName/YourAppName.ServiceDefaults.csproj" highlight="11":::

The service defaults project template imposes a `FrameworkReference` dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to take a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, you can create a custom service defaults project. For more information, see [Custom service defaults](#custom-service-defaults).

The `IsAspireSharedProject` property is set to `true`, which indicates that this project is a shared project. The .NET Aspire tooling uses this project as a reference for other projects added to a .NET Aspire solution. When you enlist the new project for orchestration, it automatically references the _YourAppName.ServiceDefaults_ project and updates the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file to call the `AddServiceDefaults` method.

## Provided extension methods

The _YourAppName.ServiceDefaults_ project exposes a single _Extensions.cs_ file that contains several opinionated extension methods:

- `AddServiceDefaults`: Adds service defaults functionality.
- `ConfigureOpenTelemetry`: Configures OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing.
- `AddDefaultHealthChecks`: Adds default health check endpoints.
- `MapDefaultEndpoints`: Maps the health checks endpoint to `/health` and the liveness endpoint to `/alive`.

### Add service defaults functionality

The `AddServiceDefaults` method defines default configurations with the following opinionated functionality:

:::code source="snippets/template/YourAppName/Extensions.cs" id="addservicedefaults":::

The preceding code:

- Configures OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing, by calling the `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` method.
- Adds default health check endpoints, by calling the `AddDefaultHealthChecks` method.
- Adds [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) functionality, by calling the `AddServiceDiscovery` method.
- Configures <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> defaults, by calling the `ConfigureHttpClientDefaults` method—which is based on [Build resilient HTTP apps: Key development patterns](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience):
  - Adds the standard HTTP resilience handler, by calling the `AddStandardResilienceHandler` method.
  - Specifies that the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IHttpClientBuilder> should use service discovery, by calling the `UseServiceDiscovery` method.
- Returns the `IHostApplicationBuilder` instance to allow for method chaining.

### OpenTelemetry configuration

Telemetry is a critical part of any cloud-native application. .NET Aspire provides a set of opinionated defaults for OpenTelemetry, which are configured with the `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` method:

:::code source="snippets/template/YourAppName/Extensions.cs" id="configureotel":::

The `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` method:

- Adds [.NET Aspire telemetry](telemetry.md) logging to include formatted messages and scopes.
- Adds OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing that include:
  - Runtime instrumentation metrics.
  - ASP.NET Core instrumentation metrics.
  - HttpClient instrumentation metrics.
  - In a development environment, the `AlwaysOnSampler` is used to view all traces.
  - Tracing details for ASP.NET Core, gRPC and HTTP instrumentation.
- Adds OpenTelemetry exporters, by calling `AddOpenTelemetryExporters`.

The `AddOpenTelemetryExporters` method is defined privately as follows:

:::code source="snippets/template/YourAppName/Extensions.cs" id="addotelexporters":::

The `AddOpenTelemetryExporters` method adds OpenTelemetry exporters based on the following conditions:

- If the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable is set, the OpenTelemetry exporter is added.
- Optionally consumers of .NET Aspire service defaults can uncomment some code to enable the Prometheus exporter, or the Azure Monitor exporter.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire telemetry](telemetry.md).

### Health checks configuration

Health checks are used by various tools and systems to assess the readiness of your app. .NET Aspire provides a set of opinionated defaults for health checks, which are configured with the `AddDefaultHealthChecks` method:

:::code source="snippets/template/YourAppName/Extensions.cs" id="addhealthchecks":::

The `AddDefaultHealthChecks` method adds a default liveness check to ensure the app is responsive. The call to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHealthChecks%2A> registers the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckService>. For more information, see [.NET Aspire health checks](health-checks.md).

#### Web app health checks configuration

To expose health checks in a web app, .NET Aspire automatically determines the type of project being referenced within the solution, and adds the appropriate call to `MapDefaultEndpoints`:

:::code source="snippets/template/YourAppName/Extensions.cs" id="mapdefaultendpoints":::

The `MapDefaultEndpoints` method:

- Allows consumers to optionally uncomment some code to enable the Prometheus endpoint.
- Maps the health checks endpoint to `/health`.
- Maps the liveness endpoint to `/alive` route where the health check tag contains `live`.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire health checks](health-checks.md).

## Custom service defaults

If the default service configuration provided by the project template is not sufficient for your needs, you have the option to create your own service defaults project. This is especially useful when your consuming project, such as a Worker project or WinForms project, cannot or does not want to have a `FrameworkReference` dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`.

To do this, create a new .NET 9.0 class library project and add the necessary dependencies to the project file, consider the following example:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Library</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.ServiceDiscovery" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Then create an extensions class that contains the necessary methods to configure the app defaults:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using OpenTelemetry.Logs;
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public static class AppDefaultsExtensions
{
    public static IHostApplicationBuilder AddAppDefaults(
        this IHostApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.ConfigureAppOpenTelemetry();

        builder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery();

            // Turn on service discovery by default

                }

                tracing.AddGrpcClientInstrumentation()
                       .AddHttpClientInstrumentation();
            });

        builder.AddOpenTelemetryExporters();

        return builder;
    }

    private static IHostApplicationBuilder AddOpenTelemetryExporters(
        this IHostApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        var useOtlpExporter =
            !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(
                builder.Configuration["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"]);

        if (useOtlpExporter)
        {
            builder.Services.Configure<OpenTelemetryLoggerOptions>(
                logging => logging.AddOtlpExporter());
            builder.Services.ConfigureOpenTelemetryMeterProvider(
                metrics => metrics.AddOtlpExporter());
            builder.Services.ConfigureOpenTelemetryTracerProvider(
                tracing => tracing.AddOtlpExporter());
        }

        return builder;
    }
}
```

This is only an example, and you can customize the `AppDefaultsExtensions` class to meet your specific needs.

## Next steps

This code is derived from the .NET Aspire Starter Application template and is intended as a starting point. You're free to modify this code however you deem necessary to meet your needs. It's important to know that service defaults project and its functionality are automatically applied to all project resources in a .NET Aspire solution.

# .NET Aspire and launch profiles

.NET Aspire makes use of _launch profiles_ defined in both the app host and service projects to simplify the process of configuring multiple aspects of the debugging and publishing experience for .NET Aspire-based distributed applications.

## Launch profile basics

When creating a new .NET application from a template developers will often see a `Properties` directory which contains a file named _launchSettings.json_. The launch settings file contains a list of _launch profiles_. Each launch profile is a collection of related options which defines how you would like `dotnet` to start your application.

The code below is an example of launch profiles in a _launchSettings.json_ file for an **ASP.NET Core** application.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5130",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7106;http://localhost:5130",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The _launchSettings.json_ file above defines two _launch profiles_, `http` and `https`. Each has its own set of environment variables, launch URLs and other options. When launching a .NET Core application developers can choose which launch profile to use.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

If no launch profile is specified, then the first launch profile is selected by default. It is possible to launch a .NET Core application without a launch profile using the `--no-launch-profile` option. Some fields from the _launchSettings.json_ file are translated to environment variables. For example, the `applicationUrl` field is converted to the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable which controls which address and port ASP.NET Core binds to.

In Visual Studio it's possible to select the launch profile when launching the application making it easy to switch between configuration scenarios when manually debugging issues:

:::image type="content" loc-scope="visual-studio" source="./media/launch-profiles/vs-launch-profile-toolbar.png" lightbox="./media/launch-profiles/vs-launch-profile-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the standard toolbar in Visual Studio with the launch profile selector highlighted.":::

When a .NET application is launched with a launch profile a special environment variable called `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE` is populated with the name of the launch profile that was used when launching the process.

## Launch profiles for .NET Aspire app host

In .NET Aspire, the AppHost is just a .NET application. As a result it has a `launchSettings.json` file just like any other application. Here is an example of the `launchSettings.json` file generated when creating a new .NET Aspire project from the starter template (`dotnet new aspire-starter`).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17134;http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:21030",
        "DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:22057"
      }
    },
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://localhost:19240",
        "DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://localhost:20154"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The .NET Aspire templates have a very similar set of _launch profiles_ to a regular ASP.NET Core application. When the .NET Aspire app project launches, it starts a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication> and hosts a web-server which is used by the .NET Aspire Dashboard to fetch information about resources which are being orchestrated by .NET Aspire.

For information about app host configuration options, see [.NET Aspire app host configuration](../app-host/configuration.md).

## Relationship between app host launch profiles and service projects

In .NET Aspire the app host is responsible for coordinating the launch of multiple service projects. When you run the app host either via the command line or from Visual Studio (or other development environment) a launch profile is selected for the app host. In turn, the app host will attempt to find a matching launch profile in the service projects it is launching and use those options to control the environment and default networking configuration for the service project.

When the app host launches a service project it doesn't simply launch the service project using the `--launch-profile` option. Therefore, there will be no `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE` environment variable set for service projects. This is because .NET Aspire modifies the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable (derived from the `applicationUrl` field in the launch profile) to use a different port. By default, .NET Aspire inserts a reverse proxy in front of the ASP.NET Core application to allow for multiple instances of the application using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReplicas%2A> method.

Other settings such as options from the `environmentVariables` field are passed through to the application without modification.

## Control launch profile selection

Ideally, it's possible to align the launch profile names between the app host and the service projects to make it easy to switch between configuration options on all projects coordinated by the app host at once. However, it may be desirable to control launch profile that a specific project uses. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> extension method provides a mechanism to do this.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>(
    "inventoryservice",
    launchProfileName: "mylaunchprofile");
```

The preceding code shows that the `inventoryservice` resource (a .NET project) is launched using the options from the `mylaunchprofile` launch profile. The launch profile precedence logic is as follows:

1. Use the launch profile specified by `launchProfileName` argument if specified.
2. Use the launch profile with the same name as the AppHost (determined by reading the `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE` environment variable).
3. Use the default (first) launch profile in _launchSettings.json_.
4. Don't use a launch profile.

To force a service project to launch without a launch profile the `launchProfileName` argument on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> method can be set to null.

## Launch profiles and endpoints

When adding an ASP.NET Core project to the app host, .NET Aspire will parse the _launchSettings.json_ file selecting the appropriate launch profile and automatically generate endpoints in the application model based on the URL(s) present in the `applicationUrl` field. To modify the endpoints that are automatically injected the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint%2A> extension method.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>("inventoryservice")
       .WithEndpoint("https", endpoint => endpoint.IsProxied = false);
```

The preceding code shows how to disable the reverse proxy that .NET Aspire deploys in front for the .NET Core application and instead allows the .NET Core application to respond directly on requests over HTTP(S). For more information on networking options within .NET Aspire see [.NET Aspire inner loop networking overview](./networking-overview.md).

# Health checks in .NET Aspire

Health checks provide availability and state information about an app. Health checks are often exposed as HTTP endpoints, but can also be used internally by the app to write logs or perform other tasks based on the current health. Health checks are typically used in combination with an external monitoring service or container orchestrator to check the status of an app. The data reported by health checks can be used for various scenarios:

- Influence decisions made by container orchestrators, load balancers, API gateways, and other management services. For instance, if the health check for a containerized app fails, it might be skipped by a load balancer routing traffic.
- Verify that underlying dependencies are available, such as a database or cache, and return an appropriate status message.
- Trigger alerts or notifications when an app isn't responding as expected.

## .NET Aspire health check endpoints

.NET Aspire exposes two default health check HTTP endpoints in **Development** environments when the `AddServiceDefaults` and `MapDefaultEndpoints` methods are called from the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file:

- The `/health` endpoint indicates if the app is running normally where it's ready to receive requests. All health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic after starting.

    ```http
    GET /health
    ```

    The `/health` endpoint returns an HTTP status code 200 and a `text/plain` value of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthStatus.Healthy> when the app is _healthy_.

- The `/alive` indicates if an app is running or has crashed and must be restarted. Only health checks tagged with the _live_ tag must pass for app to be considered alive.

    ```http
    GET /alive
    ```

    The `/alive` endpoint returns an HTTP status code 200 and a `text/plain` value of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthStatus.Healthy> when the app is _alive_.

The `AddServiceDefaults` and `MapDefaultEndpoints` methods also apply various configurations to your app beyond just health checks, such as [OpenTelemetry](telemetry.md) and [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md) configurations.

### Non-development environments

In non-development environments, the `/health` and `/alive` endpoints are disabled by default. If you need to enable them, its recommended to protect these endpoints with various routing features, such as host filtering and/or authorization. For more information, see [Health checks in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks#use-health-checks-routing).

Additionally, it may be advantageous to configure request timeouts and output caching for these endpoints to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks. To do so, consider the following modified `AddDefaultHealthChecks` method:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/healthz/Healthz.ServiceDefaults/Extensions.cs" id="healthchecks":::

The preceding code:

- Adds a timeout of 5 seconds to the health check requests with a policy named `HealthChecks`.
- Adds a 10-second cache to the health check responses with a policy named `HealthChecks`.

Now consider the updated `MapDefaultEndpoints` method:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/healthz/Healthz.ServiceDefaults/Extensions.cs" id="mapendpoints":::

The preceding code:

- Groups the health check endpoints under the `/` path.
- Caches the output and specifies a request time with the corresponding `HealthChecks` policy.

In addition to the updated `AddDefaultHealthChecks` and `MapDefaultEndpoints` methods, you must also add the corresponding services for both request timeouts and output caching.

In the appropriate consuming app's entry point (usually the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file), add the following code:

```csharp
// Wherever your services are being registered.
// Before the call to Build().
builder.Services.AddRequestTimeouts();
builder.Services.AddOutputCache();

var app = builder.Build();

// Wherever your app has been built, before the call to Run().
app.UseRequestTimeouts();
app.UseOutputCache();

app.Run();
```

For more information, see [Request timeouts middleware in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/performance/timeouts) and [Output caching middleware in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output).

## Integration health checks

.NET Aspire integrations can also register additional health checks for your app. These health checks contribute to the returned status of the `/health` and `/alive` endpoints. For example, the .NET Aspire PostgreSQL integration automatically adds a health check to verify the following conditions:

- A database connection could be established
- A database query could be executed successfully

If either of these operations fail, the corresponding health check also fails.

### Configure health checks

You can disable health checks for a given integration using one of the available configuration options. .NET Aspire integrations support [Microsoft.Extensions.Configurations](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration) to apply settings through config files such as _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Npgsql": {
      "DisableHealthChecks": true,
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use an inline delegate to configure health checks:

```csharp
builder.AddNpgsqlDbContext<MyDbContext>(
    "postgresdb",
    static settings => settings.DisableHealthChecks  = true);
```

description: Learn about essential telemetry concepts for .NET Aspire.
ms.date: 12/08/2023

# .NET Aspire telemetry

One of the primary objectives of .NET Aspire is to ensure that apps are straightforward to debug and diagnose. .NET Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as the pillars of observability, using the [.NET OpenTelemetry SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet).

- **[Logging](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/logging-tracing)**: Log events describe what's happening as an app runs. A baseline set is enabled for .NET Aspire integrations by default and more extensive logging can be enabled on-demand to diagnose particular problems.

- **[Tracing](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing)**: Traces correlate log events that are part of the same logical activity (e.g. the handling of a single request), even if they're spread across multiple machines or processes.

- **[Metrics](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics)**: Metrics expose the performance and health characteristics of an app as simple numerical values. As a result, they have low performance overhead and many services configure them as always-on telemetry. This also makes them suitable for triggering alerts when potential problems are detected.

Together, these types of telemetry allow you to gain insights into your application's behavior and performance using various monitoring and analysis tools. Depending on the backing service, some integrations may only support some of these features.

## .NET Aspire OpenTelemetry integration

The [.NET OpenTelemetry SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) includes features for gathering data from several .NET APIs, including <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger>, <xref:System.Activities.Activity>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Instrument%601>. These APIs correspond to telemetry features like logging, tracing, and metrics. .NET Aspire projects define OpenTelemetry SDK configurations in the _ServiceDefaults_ project. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](service-defaults.md).

By default, the `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` method enables logging, tracing, and metrics for the app. It also adds exporters for these data points so they can be collected by other monitoring tools.

## Export OpenTelemetry data for monitoring

The .NET OpenTelemetry SDK facilitates the export of this telemetry data to a data store or reporting tool. The telemetry export mechanism relies on the [OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol), which serves as a standardized approach for transmitting telemetry data through REST or gRPC. The `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` method also registers exporters to provide your telemetry data to other monitoring tools, such as Prometheus or Azure Monitor. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry configuration](service-defaults.md#opentelemetry-configuration).

## OpenTelemetry environment variables

OpenTelemetry has a [list of known environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) that configure the most important behavior for collecting and exporting telemetry. OpenTelemetry SDKs, including the .NET SDK, support reading these variables.

.NET Aspire projects launch with environment variables that configure the name and ID of the app in exported telemetry and set the address endpoint of the OTLP server to export data. For example:

- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` = myfrontend
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` = service.instance.id=1a5f9c1e-e5ba-451b-95ee-ced1ee89c168
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` = `http://localhost:4318`

The environment variables are automatically set in local development.

## .NET Aspire local development

When you create a .NET Aspire project, the .NET Aspire dashboard provides a UI for viewing app telemetry by default. Telemetry data is sent to the dashboard using OTLP, and the dashboard implements an OTLP server to receive telemetry data and store it in memory. The .NET Aspire debugging workflow is as follows:

- Developer starts the .NET Aspire project with debugging, presses <kbd>F5</kbd>.
- .NET Aspire dashboard and developer control plane (DCP) start.
- App configuration is run in the _AppHost_ project.
  - OpenTelemetry environment variables are automatically added to .NET projects during app configuration.
  - DCP provides the name (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`) and ID (`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`) of the app in exported telemetry.
  - The OTLP endpoint is an HTTP/2 port started by the dashboard. This endpoint is set in the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable on each project. That tells projects to export telemetry back to the dashboard.
  - Small export intervals (`OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY`, `OTEL_BLRP_SCHEDULE_DELAY`, `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`) so data is quickly available in the dashboard. Small values are used in local development to prioritize dashboard responsiveness over efficiency.
- The DCP starts configured projects, containers, and executables.
- Once started, apps send telemetry to the dashboard.
- Dashboard displays near real-time telemetry of all .NET Aspire projects.

All of these steps happen internally, so in most cases the developer simply needs to run the app to see this process in action.

## .NET Aspire deployment

.NET Aspire deployment environments should configure OpenTelemetry environment variables that make sense for their environment. For example, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` should be configured to the environment's local OTLP collector or monitoring service.

.NET Aspire telemetry works best in environments that support OTLP. OTLP exporting is disabled if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` isn't configured.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire deployments](../deployment/overview.md).

# .NET Aspire integrations overview

.NET Aspire integrations are a curated suite of NuGet packages selected to facilitate the integration of cloud-native applications with prominent services and platforms, such as Redis and PostgreSQL. Each integration furnishes essential cloud-native functionalities through either automatic provisioning or standardized configuration patterns.

> [!TIP]
> Always strive to use the latest version of .NET Aspire integrations to take advantage of the latest features, improvements, and security updates.

## Integration responsibilities

Most .NET Aspire integrations are made up of two separate libraries, each with a different responsibility. One type represents resources within the [_app host_](app-host-overview.md) project—known as [hosting integrations](#hosting-integrations). The other type of integration represents client libraries that connect to the resources modeled by hosting integrations, and they're known as [client integrations](#client-integrations).

### Hosting integrations

Hosting integrations configure applications by provisioning resources (like containers or cloud resources) or pointing to existing instances (such as a local SQL server). These packages model various services, platforms, or capabilities, including caches, databases, logging, storage, and messaging systems.

Hosting integrations extend the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> interface, enabling the _app host_ project to express resources within its [_app model_](app-host-overview.md#terminology). The official [hosting integration NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=owner%3A+aspire+tags%3A+aspire+hosting+integration&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance) are tagged with `aspire`, `integration`, and `hosting`. In addition to the official hosting integrations, the [community has created hosting integrations](../community-toolkit/overview.md) for various services and platforms as part of the Community Toolkit.

For information on creating a custom _hosting integration_, see [Create custom .NET Aspire hosting integration](../extensibility/custom-hosting-integration.md).

### Client integrations

Client integrations wire up client libraries to [dependency injection (DI)](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection), define configuration schema, and add [health checks](health-checks.md), [resiliency](/dotnet/core/resilience), and [telemetry](telemetry.md) where applicable. .NET Aspire client integration libraries are prefixed with `Aspire.` and then include the full package name that they integrate with, such as `Aspire.StackExchange.Redis`.

These packages configure existing client libraries to connect to hosting integrations. They extend the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> interface allowing client-consuming projects, such as your web app or API, to use the connected resource. The official [client integration NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=owner%3A+aspire+tags%3A+aspire+client+integration&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance) are tagged with `aspire`, `integration`, and `client`. In addition to the official client integrations, the [community has created client integrations](../community-toolkit/overview.md) for various services and platforms as part of the Community Toolkit.

For more information on creating a custom client integration, see [Create custom .NET Aspire client integrations](../extensibility/custom-client-integration.md).

### Relationship between hosting and client integrations

Hosting and client integrations are best when used together, but are **not** coupled and can be used separately. Some hosting integrations don't have a corresponding client integration. Configuration is what makes the hosting integration work with the client integration.

Consider the following diagram that depicts the relationship between hosting and client integrations:

:::image type="content" source="media/integrations-thumb.png" lightbox="media/integrations.png" alt-text="A diagram ":::

The app host project is where hosting integrations are used. Configuration, specifically environment variables, is injected into projects, executables, and containers, allowing client integrations to connect to the hosting integrations.

## Integration features

When you add a client integration to a project within your .NET Aspire solution, [service defaults](service-defaults.md) are automatically applied to that project; meaning the Service Defaults project is referenced and the `AddServiceDefaults` extension method is called. These defaults are designed to work well in most scenarios and can be customized as needed. The following service defaults are applied:

- **Observability and telemetry**: Automatically sets up logging, tracing, and metrics configurations:

  - **[Logging](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/logging-tracing)**: A technique where code is instrumented to produce logs of interesting events that occurred while the program was running.
  - **[Tracing](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing)**: A specialized form of logging that helps you localize failures and performance issues within applications distributed across multiple machines or processes.
  - **[Metrics](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics)**: Numerical measurements recorded over time to monitor application performance and health. Metrics are often used to generate alerts when potential problems are detected.

- **[Health checks](health-checks.md)**: Exposes HTTP endpoints to provide basic availability and state information about an app. Health checks are used to influence decisions made by container orchestrators, load balancers, API gateways, and other management services.
- **[Resiliency](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience)**: The ability of your system to react to failure and still remain functional. Resiliency extends beyond preventing failures to include recovering and reconstructing your cloud-native environment back to a healthy state.

## Versioning considerations

Hosting and client integrations are updated each release to target the latest stable versions of dependent resources. When container images are updated with new image versions, the hosting integrations update to these new versions. Similarly, when a new NuGet version is available for a dependent client library, the corresponding client integration updates to the new version. This ensures the latest features and security updates are available to applications. The .NET Aspire update type (major, minor, patch) doesn't necessarily indicate the type of update in dependent resources. For example, a new major version of a dependent resource may be updated in a .NET Aspire patch release, if necessary.

When major breaking changes happen in dependent resources, integrations may temporarily split into version-dependent packages to ease updating across the breaking change. For more information, see the [first example of such a breaking change](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3956).

## Official integrations

.NET Aspire provides many integrations to help you build cloud-native applications. These integrations are designed to work seamlessly with the .NET Aspire app host and client libraries. The following sections detail cloud-agnostic, Azure-specific, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Community Toolkit integrations.

# .NET Aspire Azure integrations overview

[Azure](/azure) is the most popular cloud platform for building and deploying [.NET applications](/dotnet/azure). The [Azure SDK for .NET](/dotnet/azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet) allows for easy management and use of Azure services. .NET Aspire provides a set of integrations with Azure services, where you're free to add new resources or connect to existing ones. This article details some common aspects of all Azure integrations in .NET Aspire and aims to help you understand how to use them.

## Add Azure resources

All .NET Aspire Azure hosting integrations expose Azure resources and by convention are added using `AddAzure*` APIs. When you add these resources to your .NET Aspire app host, they represent an Azure service. The `AddAzure*` API returns an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1> where `T` is the type of Azure resource. These `IResourceBuilder<T>` (builder) interfaces provide a fluent API that allows you to configure the underlying Azure resource within the [app model](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#terminology). There are APIs for adding new Azure resources, marking resources as existing, and configuring how the resources behave in various execution contexts.

### Typical developer experience

When your .NET Aspire app host contains Azure resources, and you run it locally (typical developer <kbd>F5</kbd> or `dotnet run` experience), the [Azure resources are provisioned](local-provisioning.md) in your Azure subscription. This allows you as the developer to debug against them locally in the context of your app host.

.NET Aspire aims to minimize costs by defaulting to _Basic_ or _Standard_ [Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)](/partner-center/developer/product-resources#sku) for its Azure integrations. While these sensible defaults are provided, you can [customize the Azure resources](#azureprovisioning-customization) to suit your needs. Additionally, some integrations support [emulators](#local-emulators) or [containers](#local-containers), which are useful for local development, testing, and debugging. By default, when you run your app locally, the Azure resources use the actual Azure service. However, you can configure them to use local emulators or containers, avoiding costs associated with the actual Azure service during local development.

### Local emulators

Some Azure services can be emulated to run locally. Currently, .NET Aspire supports the following Azure emulators:

| Hosting integration | Description |
|--|--|
| Azure Cosmos DB | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosExtensions.RunAsEmulator*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureCosmosDBResource>` to configure the Cosmos DB resource to be [emulated with the NoSQL API](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-develop-emulator). |
| Azure Event Hubs | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.RunAsEmulator*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureEventHubsResource>` to configure the Event Hubs resource to be [emulated](/azure/event-hubs/overview-emulator). |
| Azure Service Bus | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.RunAsEmulator*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureServiceBusResource>` to configure the Service Bus resource to be [emulated with Service Bus emulator](/azure/service-bus-messaging/overview-emulator). |
| Azure SignalR Service | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSignalRExtensions.RunAsEmulator*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureSignalRResource>` to configure the SignalR resource to be [emulated with Azure SignalR emulator](/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-howto-emulator). |
| Azure Storage | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureStorageExtensions.RunAsEmulator*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureStorageResource>` to configure the Storage resource to be [emulated with Azurite](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite). |

To have your Azure resources use the local emulators, chain a call the `RunAsEmulator` method on the Azure resource builder. This method configures the Azure resource to use the local emulator instead of the actual Azure service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Calling any of the available `RunAsEmulator` APIs on an Azure resource builder doesn't effect the [publishing manifest](../deployment/manifest-format.md). When you publish your app, [generated Bicep file](#infrastructure-as-code) reflects the actual Azure service, not the local emulator.

### Local containers

Some Azure resources can be substituted locally using open-source or on-premises containers. To substitute an Azure resource locally in a container, chain a call to the `RunAsContainer` method on the Azure resource builder. This method configures the Azure resource to use a containerized version of the service for local development and testing, rather than the actual Azure service.

Currently, .NET Aspire supports the following Azure services as containers:

| Hosting integration | Details |
|--|--|
| Azure Cache for Redis | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureRedisExtensions.RunAsContainer*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureRedisCacheResource>` to configure it to run locally in a container, based on the `docker.io/library/redis` image. |
| Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzurePostgresExtensions.RunAsContainer*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzurePostgresFlexibleServerResource>` to configure it to run locally in a container, based on the `docker.io/library/postgres` image. |
| Azure SQL Server | Call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSqlExtensions.RunAsContainer*?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureSqlServerResource>` to configure it to run locally in a container, based on the `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` image. |

> [!NOTE]
> Like emulators, calling `RunAsContainer` on an Azure resource builder doesn't effect the [publishing manifest](../deployment/manifest-format.md). When you publish your app, the [generated Bicep file](#infrastructure-as-code) reflects the actual Azure service, not the local container.

### Understand Azure integration APIs

.NET Aspire's strength lies in its ability to provide an amazing developer inner-loop. The Azure integrations are no different. They provide a set of common APIs and patterns that are shared across all Azure resources. These APIs and patterns are designed to make it easy to work with Azure resources in a consistent manner.

In the preceding containers section, you saw how to run Azure services locally in containers. If you're familiar with .NET Aspire, you might wonder how calling `AddAzureRedis("redis").RunAsContainer()` to get a local `docker.io/library/redis` container differs from `AddRedis("redis")`—as they both result in the same local container.

The answer is that there's no difference when running locally. However, when they're published you get different resources:

| API | Run mode | Publish mode |
|--|--|--|
| [AddAzureRedis("redis").RunAsContainer()](xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureRedisExtensions.RunAsContainer*) | Local Redis container | Azure Cache for Redis |
| [AddRedis("redis")](xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedis*) | Local Redis container | Azure Container App with Redis image |

The same is true for SQL and PostgreSQL services:

| API | Run mode | Publish mode |
|--|--|--|
| [AddAzurePostgresFlexibleServer("postgres").RunAsContainer()](xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzurePostgresExtensions.RunAsContainer*) | Local PostgreSQL container | Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server |
| [AddPostgres("postgres")](xref:Aspire.Hosting.PostgresBuilderExtensions.AddPostgres*) | Local PostgreSQL container | Azure Container App with PostgreSQL image |
| [AddAzureSqlServer("sql").RunAsContainer()](xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSqlExtensions.RunAsContainer*) | Local SQL Server container | Azure SQL Server |
| [AddSqlServer("sql")](xref:Aspire.Hosting.SqlServerBuilderExtensions.AddSqlServer*) | Local SQL Server container | Azure Container App with SQL Server image |

For more information on the difference between run and publish modes, see [.NET Aspire app host: Execution context](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#execution-context).

### APIs for expressing Azure resources in different modes

The distributed application builder, part of the [app host](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md), uses the builder pattern to `AddAzure*` resources to the [_app model_](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#terminology). Developers can configure these resources and define their behavior in different execution contexts. Azure hosting integrations provide APIs to specify how these resources should be "published" and "run."

When the app host executes, the [_execution context_](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#execution-context) is used to determine whether the app host is in <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationOperation.Run> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationOperation.Publish> mode. The naming conventions for these APIs indicate the intended action for the resource.

The following table summarizes the naming conventions used to express Azure resources:

| Operation | API | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Publish | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureResourceExtensions.PublishAsConnectionString``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0})> | Changes the resource to be published as a connection string reference in the manifest. |
| Publish | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.PublishAsExisting*> | Uses an existing Azure resource when the application is deployed instead of creating a new one. |
| Run | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSqlExtensions.RunAsContainer(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureSqlServerResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.SqlServerServerResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureRedisExtensions.RunAsContainer(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureRedisCacheResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.RedisResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzurePostgresExtensions.RunAsContainer(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzurePostgresFlexibleServerResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.PostgresServerResource}})> | Configures an equivalent container to run locally. For more information, see [Local containers](#local-containers). |
| Run | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosExtensions.RunAsEmulator(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosDBResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureCosmosDBEmulatorResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSignalRExtensions.RunAsEmulator(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureSignalRResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureSignalREmulatorResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureStorageExtensions.RunAsEmulator(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureStorageResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureStorageEmulatorResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.RunAsEmulator(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsEmulatorResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> <br/> <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.RunAsEmulator(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusResource},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusEmulatorResource}})?displayProperty=nameWithType> | Configures the Azure resource to be emulated. For more information, see [Local emulators](#local-emulators). |
| Run | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.RunAsExisting*> | Uses an existing resource when the application is running instead of creating a new one. |
| Publish and Run | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.AsExisting``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource})> | Uses an existing resource regardless of the operation. |

> [!NOTE]
> Not all APIs are available on all Azure resources. For example, some Azure resources can be containerized or emulated, while others can't.

For more information on execution modes, see [Execution context](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#execution-context).

#### General run mode API use cases

Use <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.RunAsExisting*> when you need to dynamically interact with an existing resource during runtime without needing to deploy or update it. Use <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.PublishAsExisting*> when declaring existing resources as part of a deployment configuration, ensuring the correct scopes and permissions are applied. Finally, use <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.AsExisting``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource})> when declaring existing resources in both configurations, with a requirement to parameterize the references.

You can query whether a resource is marked as an existing resource, by calling the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.IsExisting(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResource)> extension method on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResource>. For more information, see [Use existing Azure resources](#use-existing-azure-resources).

## Use existing Azure resources

.NET Aspire provides support for referencing existing Azure resources. You mark an existing resource through the `PublishAsExisting`, `RunAsExisting`, and `AsExisting` APIs. These APIs allow developers to reference already-deployed Azure resources, configure them, and generate appropriate deployment manifests using Bicep templates.

Existing resources referenced with these APIs can be enhanced with role assignments and other customizations that are available with .NET Aspire's [infrastructure as code capabilities](#infrastructure-as-code). These APIs are limited to Azure resources that can be deployed with Bicep templates.

### Configure existing Azure resources for run mode

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.RunAsExisting*> method is used when a distributed application is executing in "run" mode. In this mode, it assumes that the referenced Azure resource already exists and integrates with it during execution without provisioning the resource. To mark an Azure resource as existing, call the `RunAsExisting` method on the resource builder. Consider the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();

var existingServiceBusName = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusName");
var existingServiceBusResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusResourceGroup");

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging")
                        .RunAsExisting(existingServiceBusName, existingServiceBusResourceGroup);

serviceBus.AddServiceBusQueue("queue");
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new `builder` instance.
- Adds a parameter named `existingServiceBusName` to the builder.
- Adds an Azure Service Bus resource named `messaging` to the builder.
- Calls the `RunAsExisting` method on the `serviceBus` resource builder, passing the `existingServiceBusName` parameter—alternatively, you can use the `string` parameter overload.
- Adds a queue named `queue` to the `serviceBus` resource.

By default, the Service Bus parameter reference is assumed to be in the same Azure resource group. However, if it's in a different resource group, you can pass the resource group explicitly as a parameter to correctly specify the appropriate resource grouping.

### Configure existing Azure resources for publish mode

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.PublishAsExisting*> method is used in "publish" mode when the intent is to declare and reference an already-existing Azure resource during publish mode. This API facilitates the creation of manifests and templates that include resource definitions that map to existing resources in Bicep.

To mark an Azure resource as existing in for the "publish" mode, call the `PublishAsExisting` method on the resource builder. Consider the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();

var existingServiceBusName = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusName");
var existingServiceBusResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusResourceGroup");

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging")
                        .PublishAsExisting(existingServiceBusName, existingServiceBusResourceGroup);

serviceBus.AddServiceBusQueue("queue");
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new `builder` instance.
- Adds a parameter named `existingServiceBusName` to the builder.
- Adds an Azure Service Bus resource named `messaging` to the builder.
- Calls the `PublishAsExisting` method on the `serviceBus` resource builder, passing the `existingServiceBusName` parameter—alternatively, you can use the `string` parameter overload.
- Adds a queue named `queue` to the `serviceBus` resource.

After the app host is executed in publish mode, the generated manifest file will include the `existingResourceName` parameter, which can be used to reference the existing Azure resource. Consider the following generated partial snippet of the manifest file:

```json
"messaging": {
  "type": "azure.bicep.v0",
  "connectionString": "{messaging.outputs.serviceBusEndpoint}",
  "path": "messaging.module.bicep",
  "params": {
    "existingServiceBusName": "{existingServiceBusName.value}",
    "principalType": "",
    "principalId": ""
  }
},
"queue": {
  "type": "value.v0",
  "connectionString": "{messaging.outputs.serviceBusEndpoint}"
}
```

For more information on the manifest file, see [.NET Aspire manifest format for deployment tool builders](../deployment/manifest-format.md).

Additionally, the generated Bicep template includes the `existingResourceName` parameter, which can be used to reference the existing Azure resource. Consider the following generated Bicep template:

```bicep
@description('The location for the resource(s) to be deployed.')
param location string = resourceGroup().location

param existingServiceBusName string

param principalType string

param principalId string

resource messaging 'Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces@2024-01-01' existing = {
  name: existingServiceBusName
}

resource messaging_AzureServiceBusDataOwner 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  name: guid(messaging.id, principalId, subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', '090c5cfd-751d-490a-894a-3ce6f1109419'))
  properties: {
    principalId: principalId
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', '090c5cfd-751d-490a-894a-3ce6f1109419')
    principalType: principalType
  }
  scope: messaging
}

resource queue 'Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/queues@2024-01-01' = {
  name: 'queue'
  parent: messaging
}

output serviceBusEndpoint string = messaging.properties.serviceBusEndpoint
```

For more information on the generated Bicep templates, see [Infrastructure as code](#infrastructure-as-code) and [consider other publishing APIs](#publish-as-azure-container-app).

> [!WARNING]
> When interacting with existing resources that require authentication, ensure the authentication strategy that you're configuring in the .NET Aspire application model aligns with the authentication strategy allowed by the existing resource. For example, it's not possible to use managed identity against an existing Azure PostgreSQL resource that isn't configured to allow managed identity. Similarly, if an existing Azure Redis resource disabled access keys, it's not possible to use access key authentication.

### Configure existing Azure resources in all modes

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ExistingAzureResourceExtensions.AsExisting``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ParameterResource})> method is used when the distributed application is running in "run" or "publish" mode. Because the `AsExisting` method operates in both scenarios, it only supports a parameterized reference to the resource name or resource group name. This approach helps prevent the use of the same resource in both testing and production environments.

To mark an Azure resource as existing, call the `AsExisting` method on the resource builder. Consider the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();

var existingServiceBusName = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusName");
var existingServiceBusResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingServiceBusResourceGroup");

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging")
                        .AsExisting(existingServiceBusName, existingServiceBusResourceGroup);

serviceBus.AddServiceBusQueue("queue");
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new `builder` instance.
- Adds a parameter named `existingServiceBusName` to the builder.
- Adds an Azure Service Bus resource named `messaging` to the builder.
- Calls the `AsExisting` method on the `serviceBus` resource builder, passing the `existingServiceBusName` parameter.
- Adds a queue named `queue` to the `serviceBus` resource.

## Add existing Azure resources with connection strings

.NET Aspire provides the ability to [connect to existing resources](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#reference-existing-resources), including Azure resources. Expressing connection strings is useful when you have existing Azure resources that you want to use in your .NET Aspire app. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> API is used with the app host's [execution context](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#execution-context) to conditionally add a connection string to the app model.

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

Consider the following example, where in _publish_ mode you add an Azure Storage resource while in _run_ mode you add a connection string to an existing Azure Storage:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
    ? builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("storage");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithReference(storage);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new `builder` instance.
- Adds an Azure Storage resource named `storage` in "publish" mode.
- Adds a connection string to an existing Azure Storage named `storage` in "run" mode.
- Adds a project named `api` to the builder.
- The `api` project references the `storage` resource regardless of the mode.

The consuming API project uses the connection string information with no knowledge of how the app host configured it. In "publish" mode, the code adds a new Azure Storage resource—which would be reflected in the [deployment manifest](../deployment/manifest-format.md) accordingly. When in "run" mode the connection string corresponds to a configuration value visible to the app host. It's assumed that all role assignments for the target resource are configured. This means, you'd likely configure an environment variable or a user secret to store the connection string. The configuration is resolved from the `ConnectionStrings__storage` (or `ConnectionStrings:storage`) configuration key. These configuration values can be viewed when the app runs. For more information, see [Resource details](../fundamentals/dashboard/explore.md#resource-details).

Unlike existing resources modeled with [the first-class `AsExisting` API](#use-existing-azure-resources), existing resource modeled as connection strings can't be enhanced with additional role assignments or infrastructure customizations.

## Publish as Azure Container App

.NET Aspire allows you to publish primitive resources as [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/overview), a serverless platform that reduces infrastructure management. Supported resource types include:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ContainerResource>: Represents a specified container.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ExecutableResource>: Represents a specified executable process.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ProjectResource>: Represents a specified .NET project.

To publish these resources, use the following APIs:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureContainerAppContainerExtensions.PublishAsAzureContainerApp``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure,Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers.ContainerApp})?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureContainerAppExecutableExtensions.PublishAsAzureContainerApp``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure,Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers.ContainerApp})?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureContainerAppProjectExtensions.PublishAsAzureContainerApp``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure,Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers.ContainerApp})?displayProperty=nameWithType>

These APIs configure the resource to be published as an Azure Container App and implicitly call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureContainerAppExtensions.AddAzureContainerAppsInfrastructure(Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder)> to add the necessary infrastructure and Bicep files to your app host. As an example, consider the following code:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();

var env = builder.AddParameter("env");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApi>("api")
                 .PublishAsAzureContainerApp<Projects.AspireApi>((infra, app) =>
                 {
                     app.Template.Containers[0].Value!.Env.Add(new ContainerAppEnvironmentVariable
                     {
                         Name = "Hello",
                         Value = env.AsProvisioningParameter(infra)
                     });
                 });
```

The preceding code:

- Creates a new `builder` instance.
- Adds a parameter named `env` to the builder.
- Adds a project named `api` to the builder.
- Calls the `PublishAsAzureContainerApp` method on the `api` resource builder, passing a lambda expression that configures the Azure Container App infrastructure—where `infra` is the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> and `app` is the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers.ContainerApp>.
  - Adds an environment variable named `Hello` to the container app, using the `env` parameter.
  - The `AsProvisioningParameter` method is used to treat `env` as either a new <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ProvisioningParameter> in infrastructure, or reuses an existing bicep parameter if one with the same name already exists.

For more information, see <xref:Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers.ContainerApp> and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.AsProvisioningParameter*>.

## Infrastructure as code

The Azure SDK for .NET provides the [📦 Azure.Provisioning](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Provisioning) NuGet package and a suite of service-specific [Azure provisioning packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=owner%3A+azure-sdk+description%3A+declarative+resource+provisioning&sortby=relevance). These Azure provisioning libraries make it easy to declaratively specify Azure infrastructure natively in .NET. Their APIs enable you to write object-oriented infrastructure in C#, resulting in Bicep. [Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) for deploying Azure resources declaratively.

<!-- TODO: Add link from here to the Azure docs when they're written. -->

While it's possible to provision Azure resources manually, .NET Aspire simplifies the process by providing a set of APIs to express Azure resources. These APIs are available as extension methods in .NET Aspire Azure hosting libraries, extending the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> interface. When you add Azure resources to your app host, they add the appropriate provisioning functionality implicitly. In other words, you don't need to call any provisioning APIs directly.

Since .NET Aspire models Azure resources within Azure hosting integrations, the Azure SDK is used to provision these resources. Bicep files are generated that define the Azure resources you need. The generated Bicep files are output alongside the manifest file when you publish your app.

There are several ways to influence the generated Bicep files:

- [Azure.Provisioning customization](#azureprovisioning-customization):
  - [Configure infrastructure](#configure-infrastructure): Customize Azure resource infrastructure.
  - [Add Azure infrastructure](#add-azure-infrastructure): Manually add Azure infrastructure to your app host.
- [Use custom Bicep templates](#use-custom-bicep-templates):
  - [Reference Bicep files](#reference-bicep-files): Add a reference to a Bicep file on disk.
  - [Reference Bicep inline](#reference-bicep-inline): Add an inline Bicep template.

### Local provisioning and `Azure.Provisioning`

To avoid conflating terms and to help disambiguate "provisioning," it's important to understand the distinction between _local provisioning_ and _Azure provisioning_:

- **_Local provisioning:_**

  By default, when you call any of the Azure hosting integration APIs to add Azure resources, the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning(Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder)> API is called implicitly. This API registers services in the dependency injection (DI) container that are used to provision Azure resources when the app host starts. This concept is known as _local provisioning_.  For more information, see [Local Azure provisioning](local-provisioning.md).

- **_`Azure.Provisioning`:_**

  `Azure.Provisioning` refers to the NuGet package, and is a set of libraries that lets you use C# to generate Bicep. The Azure hosting integrations in .NET Aspire use these libraries under the covers to generate Bicep files that define the Azure resources you need. For more information, see [`Azure.Provisioning` customization](#azureprovisioning-customization).

### `Azure.Provisioning` customization

All .NET Aspire Azure hosting integrations expose various Azure resources, and they're all subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type—which itself inherits the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource>. This enables extensions that are generically type-constrained to this type, allowing for a fluent API to customize the infrastructure to your liking. While .NET Aspire provides defaults, you're free to influence the generated Bicep using these APIs.

#### Configure infrastructure

Regardless of the Azure resource you're working with, to configure its underlying infrastructure, you chain a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> extension method. This method allows you to customize the infrastructure of the Azure resource by passing a `configure` delegate of type `Action<AzureResourceInfrastructure>`. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type is a subclass of the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure?displayProperty=fullName>. This type exposes a massive API surface area for configuring the underlying infrastructure of the Azure resource.

Consider the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureInfrastructure.cs" id="infra":::

The preceding code:

- Adds a parameter named `storage-sku`.
- Adds Azure Storage with the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureStorageExtensions.AddAzureStorage*> API named `storage`.
- Chains a call to `ConfigureInfrastructure` to customize the Azure Storage infrastructure:
  - Gets the provisionable resources.
  - Filters to a single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccount>.
  - Assigns the `storage-sku` parameter to the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccount.Sku?displayProperty=nameWithType> property:
    - A new instance of the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageSku> has its `Name` property assigned from the result of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.AsProvisioningParameter*> API.

This exemplifies flowing an [external parameter](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md) into the Azure Storage infrastructure, resulting in the generated Bicep file reflecting the desired configuration.

#### Add Azure infrastructure

Not all Azure services are exposed as .NET Aspire integrations. While they might be at a later time, you can still provision services that are available in `Azure.Provisioning.*` libraries. Imagine a scenario where you have worker service that's responsible for managing an Azure Container Registry. Now imagine that an app host project takes a dependency on the [📦 Azure.Provisioning.ContainerRegistry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Provisioning.ContainerRegistry) NuGet package.

You can use the `AddAzureInfrastructure` API to add the Azure Container Registry infrastructure to your app host:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.AddAzureInfra.cs" id="add":::

The preceding code:

- Calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.AddAzureInfrastructure*> with a name of `acr`.
- Provides a `configureInfrastructure` delegate to customize the Azure Container Registry infrastructure:
  - Instantiates a <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ContainerRegistry.ContainerRegistryService> with the name `acr` and a standard SKU.
  - Adds the Azure Container Registry service to the `infra` variable.
  - Instantiates a <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ProvisioningOutput> with the name `registryName`, a type of `string`, and a value that corresponds to the name of the Azure Container Registry.
  - Adds the output to the `infra` variable.
- Adds a project named `worker` to the builder.
- Chains a call to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEnvironment*> to set the `ACR_REGISTRY_NAME` environment variable in the project to the value of the `registryName` output.

The functionality demonstrates how to add Azure infrastructure to your app host project, even if the Azure service isn't directly exposed as a .NET Aspire integration. It further shows how to flow the output of the Azure Container Registry into the environment of a dependent project.

Consider the resulting Bicep file:

:::code language="bicep" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/acr.module.bicep":::

The Bicep file reflects the desired configuration of the Azure Container Registry, as defined by the `AddAzureInfrastructure` API.

### Use custom Bicep templates

When you're targeting Azure as your desired cloud provider, you can use Bicep to define your infrastructure as code. It aims to drastically simplify the authoring experience with a cleaner syntax and better support for modularity and code reuse.

While .NET Aspire provides a set of prebuilt Bicep templates, there might be times when you either want to customize the templates or create your own. This section explains the concepts and corresponding APIs that you can use to customize the Bicep templates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section isn't intended to teach you Bicep, but rather to provide guidance on how to create custom Bicep templates for use with .NET Aspire.

As part of the [Azure deployment story for .NET Aspire](../deployment/overview.md), the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) provides an understanding of your .NET Aspire project and the ability to deploy it to Azure. The `azd` CLI uses the Bicep templates to deploy the application to Azure.

#### Install `Aspire.Hosting.Azure` package

When you want to reference Bicep files, it's possible that you're not using any of the Azure hosting integrations. In this case, you can still reference Bicep files by installing the `Aspire.Hosting.Azure` package. This package provides the necessary APIs to reference Bicep files and customize the Azure resources.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using any of the Azure hosting integrations, you don't need to install the `Aspire.Hosting.Azure` package, as it's a transitive dependency.

To use any of this functionality, the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure) NuGet package must be installed:

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

#### What to expect from the examples

All the examples in this section assume that you're using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure> namespace. Additionally, the examples assume you have an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> instance:

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.Azure;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Examples go here...

builder.Build().Run();
```

By default, when you call any of the Bicep-related APIs, a call is also made to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning%2A> that adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during application startup. For more information, see [Local provisioning and `Azure.Provisioning`](#local-provisioning-and-azureprovisioning).

#### Reference Bicep files

Imagine that you have a Bicep template in a file named `storage.bicep` that provisions an Azure Storage Account:

:::code language="bicep" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/storage.bicep":::

To add a reference to the Bicep file on disk, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureBicepResourceExtensions.AddBicepTemplate%2A> method. Consider the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.ReferenceBicep.cs" id="addfile":::

The preceding code adds a reference to a Bicep file located at `../infra/storage.bicep`. The file paths should be relative to the _app host_ project. This reference results in an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource> being added to the application's resources collection with the `"storage"` name, and the API returns an `IResourceBuilder<AzureBicepResource>` instance that can be used to further customize the resource.

#### Reference Bicep inline

While having a Bicep file on disk is the most common scenario, you can also add Bicep templates inline. Inline templates can be useful when you want to define a template in code or when you want to generate the template dynamically. To add an inline Bicep template, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureBicepResourceExtensions.AddBicepTemplateString%2A> method with the Bicep template as a `string`. Consider the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.InlineBicep.cs" id="addinline":::

In this example, the Bicep template is defined as an inline `string` and added to the application's resources collection with the name `"ai"`. This example provisions an Azure AI resource.

#### Pass parameters to Bicep templates

[Bicep supports accepting parameters](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/parameters), which can be used to customize the behavior of the template. To pass parameters to a Bicep template from .NET Aspire, chain calls to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureBicepResourceExtensions.WithParameter%2A> method as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.PassParameter.cs" id="addparameter":::

The preceding code:

- Adds a parameter named `"region"` to the `builder` instance.
- Adds a reference to a Bicep file located at `../infra/storage.bicep`.
- Passes the `"region"` parameter to the Bicep template, which is resolved using the standard parameter resolution.
- Passes the `"storageName"` parameter to the Bicep template with a _hardcoded_ value.
- Passes the `"tags"` parameter to the Bicep template with an array of strings.

For more information, see [External parameters](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md).

##### Well-known parameters

.NET Aspire provides a set of well-known parameters that can be passed to Bicep templates. These parameters are used to provide information about the application and the environment to the Bicep templates. The following well-known parameters are available:

| Field | Description | Value |
|--|--|--|
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.KeyVaultName?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The name of the key vault resource used to store secret outputs. | `"keyVaultName"` |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.Location?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The location of the resource. This is required for all resources. | `"location"` |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The resource ID of the log analytics workspace. | `"logAnalyticsWorkspaceId"` |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.PrincipalId?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The principal ID of the current user or managed identity. | `"principalId"` |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.PrincipalName?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The principal name of the current user or managed identity. | `"principalName"` |
| <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.PrincipalType?displayProperty=nameWithType> | The principal type of the current user or managed identity. Either `User` or `ServicePrincipal`. | `"principalType"` |

To use a well-known parameter, pass the parameter name to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureBicepResourceExtensions.WithParameter%2A> method, such as `WithParameter(AzureBicepResource.KnownParameters.KeyVaultName)`. You don't pass values for well-known parameters, as .NET Aspire resolves them on your behalf.

Consider an example where you want to set up an Azure Event Grid webhook. You might define the Bicep template as follows:

 :::code language="bicep" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/event-grid-webhook.bicep" highlight="3-4,27-35":::

This Bicep template defines several parameters, including the `topicName`, `webHookEndpoint`, `principalId`, `principalType`, and the optional `location`. To pass these parameters to the Bicep template, you can use the following code snippet:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.PassParameter.cs" id="addwellknownparams":::

- The `webHookApi` project is added as a reference to the `builder`.
- The `topicName` parameter is passed a hardcoded name value.
- The `webHookEndpoint` parameter is passed as an expression that resolves to the URL from the `api` project references' "https" endpoint with the `/hook` route.
- The `principalId` and `principalType` parameters are passed as well-known parameters.

The well-known parameters are convention-based and shouldn't be accompanied with a corresponding value when passed using the `WithParameter` API. Well-known parameters simplify some common functionality, such as _role assignments_, when added to the Bicep templates, as shown in the preceding example. Role assignments are required for the Event Grid webhook to send events to the specified endpoint. For more information, see [Event Grid Data Sender role assignment](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/integration#eventgrid-data-sender).

### Get outputs from Bicep references

In addition to passing parameters to Bicep templates, you can also get outputs from the Bicep templates. Consider the following Bicep template, as it defines an `output` named `endpoint`:

:::code language="bicep" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/storage-out.bicep":::

The Bicep defines an output named `endpoint`. To get the output from the Bicep template, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureBicepResourceExtensions.GetOutput%2A> method on an `IResourceBuilder<AzureBicepResource>` instance as demonstrated in following C# code snippet:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.GetOutputReference.cs" id="getoutput":::

In this example, the output from the Bicep template is retrieved and stored in an `endpoint` variable. Typically, you would pass this output as an environment variable to another resource that relies on it. For instance, if you had an ASP.NET Core Minimal API project that depended on this endpoint, you could pass the output as an environment variable to the project using the following code snippet:

```csharp
var storage = builder.AddBicepTemplate(
                name: "storage",
                bicepFile: "../infra/storage.bicep"
            );

var endpoint = storage.GetOutput("endpoint");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireSample_ApiService>(
        name: "apiservice"
    )
    .WithEnvironment("STORAGE_ENDPOINT", endpoint);
```

For more information, see [Bicep outputs](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/outputs).

### Get secret outputs from Bicep references

It's important to [avoid outputs for secrets](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/scenarios-secrets#avoid-outputs-for-secrets) when working with Bicep. If an output is considered a _secret_, meaning it shouldn't be exposed in logs or other places, you can treat it as such. This can be achieved by storing the secret in Azure Key Vault and referencing it in the Bicep template. .NET Aspire's Azure integration provides a pattern for securely storing outputs from the Bicep template by allows resources to use the `keyVaultName` parameter to store secrets in Azure Key Vault.

Consider the following Bicep template as an example the helps to demonstrate this concept of securing secret outputs:

:::code language="bicep" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/cosmosdb.bicep" highlight="2,41":::

The preceding Bicep template expects a `keyVaultName` parameter, among several other parameters. It then defines an Azure Cosmos DB resource and stashes a secret into Azure Key Vault, named `connectionString` which represents the fully qualified connection string to the Cosmos DB instance. To access this secret connection string value, you can use the following code snippet:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/AppHost.Bicep/Program.cs" id="secrets":::

In the preceding code snippet, the `cosmos` Bicep template is added as a reference to the `builder`. The `connectionString` secret output is retrieved from the Bicep template and stored in a variable. The secret output is then passed as an environment variable (`ConnectionStrings__cosmos`) to the `api` project. This environment variable is used to connect to the Cosmos DB instance.

When this resource is deployed, the underlying deployment mechanism will automatically [Reference secrets from Azure Key Vault](/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets?tabs=azure-portal#reference-secret-from-key-vault). To guarantee secret isolation, .NET Aspire creates a Key Vault per source.

> [!NOTE]
> In _local provisioning_ mode, the secret is extracted from Key Vault and set it in an environment variable. For more information, see [Local Azure provisioning](local-provisioning.md).

## Publishing

When you publish your app, the Azure provisioning generated Bicep is used by the Azure Developer CLI to create the Azure resources in your Azure subscription. .NET Aspire outputs a [publishing manifest](../deployment/manifest-format.md), that's also a vital part of the publishing process. The Azure Developer CLI is a command-line tool that provides a set of commands to manage Azure resources.

For more information on publishing and deployment, see [Deploy a .NET Aspire project to Azure Container Apps using the Azure Developer CLI (in-depth guide)](../deployment/azure/aca-deployment-azd-in-depth.md).

# Local Azure provisioning

.NET Aspire simplifies local cloud-native app development with its compelling app host model. This model allows you to run your app locally with the same configuration and services as in Azure. In this article you learn how to provision Azure resources from your local development environment through the [.NET Aspire app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host).

> [!NOTE]
> To be clear, resources are provisioned in Azure, but the provisioning process is initiated from your local development environment. To optimize your local development experience, consider using emulator or containers when available. For more information, see [Typical developer experience](integrations-overview.md#typical-developer-experience).

## Requirements

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, you can create a free one at [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). For provisioning functionality to work correctly, you'll need to be authenticated with Azure. Ensure that you have the [Azure Developer CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed. Additionally, you'll need to provide some configuration values so that the provisioning logic can create resources on your behalf.

## App host provisioning APIs

The app host provides a set of APIs to express Azure resources. These APIs are available as extension methods in .NET Aspire Azure hosting libraries, extending the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> interface. When you add Azure resources to your app host, they'll add the appropriate provisioning functionality implicitly. In other words, you don't need to call any provisioning APIs directly.

When the app host starts, the following provisioning logic is executed:

1. The `Azure` configuration section is validated.
1. When invalid the dashboard and app host output provides hints as to what's missing. For more information, see [Missing configuration value hints](#missing-configuration-value-hints).
1. When valid Azure resources are conditionally provisioned:
    1. If an Azure deployment for a given resource doesn't exist, it's created and configured as a deployment.
    1. The configuration of said deployment is stamped with a checksum as a means to support only provisioning resources as necessary.

### Use existing Azure resources

The app host automatically manages provisioning of Azure resources. The first time the app host runs, it provisions the resources specified in the app host. Subsequent runs don't provision the resources again unless the app host configuration changes.

If you've already provisioned Azure resources outside of the app host and want to use them, you can provide the connection string with the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> API as shown in the following Azure Key Vault example:

```csharp
// Service registration
var secrets = builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
    ? builder.AddAzureKeyVault("secrets")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("secrets");

// Service consumption
builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(secrets)
```

The preceding code snippet shows how to add an Azure Key Vault to the app host. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureKeyVaultResourceExtensions.AddAzureKeyVault*> API is used to add the Azure Key Vault to the app host. The `AddConnectionString` API is used to provide the connection string to the app host.

Alternatively, for some Azure resources, you can opt-in to running them as an emulator with the `RunAsEmulator` API. This API is available for [Azure Cosmos DB](../database/azure-cosmos-db-integration.md) and [Azure Storage](../storage/azure-storage-integrations.md) integrations. For example, to run Azure Cosmos DB as an emulator, you can use the following code snippet:

```csharp
var cosmos = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmos")
                    .RunAsEmulator();
```

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureCosmosExtensions.RunAsEmulator*> API configures an Azure Cosmos DB resource to be emulated using the Azure Cosmos DB emulator with the NoSQL API.

### .NET Aspire Azure hosting integrations

If you're using Azure resources in your app host, you're using one or more of the [.NET Aspire Azure hosting integrations](integrations-overview.md). These hosting libraries provide extension methods to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> interface to add Azure resources to your app host.

## Configuration

When utilizing Azure resources in your local development environment, you need to provide the necessary configuration values. Configuration values are specified under the `Azure` section:

- `SubscriptionId`: The Azure subscription ID.
- `AllowResourceGroupCreation`: A boolean value that indicates whether to create a new resource group.
- `ResourceGroup`: The name of the resource group to use.
- `Location`: The Azure region to use.

Consider the following example _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ configuration:

```json
{
  "Azure": {
    "SubscriptionId": "<Your subscription id>",
    "AllowResourceGroupCreation": true,
    "ResourceGroup": "<Valid resource group name>",
    "Location": "<Valid Azure location>"
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended to store these values as app secrets. For more information, see [Manage app secrets](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets).

After you've configured the necessary values, you can start provisioning Azure resources in your local development environment.

### Azure provisioning credential store

The .NET Aspire app host uses a credential store for Azure resource authentication and authorization. Depending on your subscription, the correct credential store may be needed for multi-tenant provisioning scenarios.

With the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure](https://nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure) NuGet package installed, and if your app host depends on Azure resources, the default Azure credential store relies on the <xref:Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential>. To change this behavior, you can set the credential store value in the _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ file, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  "Azure": {
    "CredentialSource": "AzureCli"
  }
}
```

As with all [configuration-based settings](/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration), you can configure these with alternative providers, such as [user secrets](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) or [environment variables](/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration-providers#environment-variable-configuration-provider). The `Azure:CredentialSource` value can be set to one of the following values:

- `AzureCli`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.AzureCliCredential>.
- `AzurePowerShell`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.AzurePowerShellCredential>.
- `VisualStudio`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.VisualStudioCredential>.
- `VisualStudioCode`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.VisualStudioCodeCredential>.
- `AzureDeveloperCli`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.AzureDeveloperCliCredential>.
- `InteractiveBrowser`: Delegates to the <xref:Azure.Identity.InteractiveBrowserCredential>.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the Azure SDK authentication and authorization, see [Credential chains in the Azure Identity library for .NET](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac#defaultazurecredential-overview).

### Tooling support

In Visual Studio, you can use Connected Services to configure the default Azure provisioning settings. Select the app host project, right-click on the **Connected Services** node, and select **Azure Resource Provisioning Settings**:

:::image type="content" loc-scope="visual-studio" source="media/azure-resource-provisioning-settings.png" lightbox="media/azure-resource-provisioning-settings.png" alt-text="Visual Studio 2022: .NET Aspire App Host project, Connected Services context menu.":::

This will open a dialog where you can configure the Azure provisioning settings, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" loc-scope="visual-studio" source="media/azure-provisioning-settings-dialog.png" lightbox="media/azure-provisioning-settings-dialog.png" alt-text="Visual Studio 2022: Azure Resource Provisioning Settings dialog.":::

### Missing configuration value hints

When the `Azure` configuration section is missing, has missing values, or is invalid, the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) provides useful hints. For example, consider an app host that's missing the `SubscriptionId` configuration value that's attempting to use an Azure Key Vault resource. The **Resources** page indicates the **State** as **Missing subscription configuration**:

:::image type="content" source="media/resources-kv-missing-subscription.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Missing subscription configuration.":::

Additionally, the **Console logs** display this information as well, consider the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/console-logs-kv-missing-subscription.png" lightbox="media/console-logs-kv-missing-subscription.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Console logs, missing subscription configuration.":::

## Known limitations

After provisioning Azure resources in this way, you must manually clean up the resources in the Azure portal as .NET Aspire doesn't provide a built-in mechanism to delete Azure resources. The easiest way to achieve this is by deleting the configured resource group. This can be done in the [Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-portal#delete-resource-group) or by using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <ResourceGroupName>
```

Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with the name of the resource group you want to delete. For more information, see [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete).

# .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development. The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration enables you to connect to existing Cosmos DB instances or create new instances from .NET with the Azure Cosmos DB emulator.

## Hosting integration

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-app-host](includes/cosmos-app-host.md)]

### Hosting integration health checks

The Azure Cosmos DB hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the Cosmos DB resource. The health check verifies that the Cosmos DB is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [📦 AspNetCore.HealthChecks.CosmosDb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.CosmosDb) NuGet package.

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Cosmos DB client. The Cosmos DB client integration registers a <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClient> instance that you can use to interact with Cosmos DB.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

### Add Cosmos DB client

In the :::no-loc text="Program.cs"::: file of your client-consuming project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireMicrosoftAzureCosmosExtensions.AddAzureCosmosClient*> extension method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register a <xref:Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClient> for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureCosmosClient(connectionName: "cosmos-db");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Cosmos DB resource in the app host project. In other words, when you call `AddAzureCosmosDB` and provide a name of `cosmos-db` that same name should be used when calling `AddAzureCosmosClient`. For more information, see [Add Azure Cosmos DB resource](#add-azure-cosmos-db-resource).

You can then retrieve the <xref:Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClient> instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(CosmosClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information on dependency injection, see [.NET dependency injection](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection).

### Add keyed Cosmos DB client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `CosmosClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Cosmos DB clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireMicrosoftAzureCosmosExtensions.AddKeyedAzureCosmosClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureCosmosClient(name: "mainDb");
builder.AddKeyedAzureCosmosClient(name: "loggingDb");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Cosmos DB resource configured two named databases, one for the `mainDb` and one for the `loggingDb`.

Then you can retrieve the `CosmosClient` instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("mainDb")] CosmosClient mainDbClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("loggingDb")] CosmosClient loggingDbClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration provides multiple options to configure the connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireMicrosoftAzureCosmosExtensions.AddAzureCosmosClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureCosmosClient("cosmos-db");
```

Then the connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "cosmos-db": "AccountEndpoint=https://{account_name}.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey={account_key};"
  }
}
```

For more information on how to format this connection string, see the ConnectionString documentation.

#### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration>. It loads the <xref:Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.MicrosoftAzureCosmosSettings> from configuration by using the `Aspire:Microsoft:Azure:Cosmos` key. The following snippet is an example of a :::no-loc text="appsettings.json"::: file that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Microsoft": {
      "Azure": {
        "Cosmos": {
          "DisableTracing": false,
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Cosmos DB client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos/ConfigurationSchema.json).

#### Use inline delegates

Also you can pass the `Action<MicrosoftAzureCosmosSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureCosmosClient(
    "cosmos-db",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

You can also set up the <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClientOptions?displayProperty=fullName> using the optional `Action<CosmosClientOptions> configureClientOptions` parameter of the `AddAzureCosmosClient` method. For example to set the <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.CosmosClientOptions.ApplicationName?displayProperty=nameWithType> user-agent header suffix for all requests issues by this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureCosmosClient(
    "cosmosConnectionName",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => clientOptions.ApplicationName = "myapp");
```

### Client integration health checks

The .NET Aspire Cosmos DB client integration currently doesn't implement health checks, though this may change in future releases.

[!INCLUDE [integration-observability-and-telemetry](../includes/integration-observability-and-telemetry.md)]

#### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure-Cosmos-Operation-Request-Diagnostics`

In addition to getting Azure Cosmos DB request diagnostics for failed requests, you can configure latency thresholds to determine which successful Azure Cosmos DB request diagnostics will be logged. The default values are 100 ms for point operations and 500 ms for non point operations.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureCosmosClient(
    "cosmosConnectionName",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => {
            clientOptions.CosmosClientTelemetryOptions = new()
            {
                CosmosThresholdOptions = new()
                {
                    PointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50),
                    NonPointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300)
                }
            };
        });
```

#### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Azure.Cosmos.Operation`

Azure Cosmos DB tracing is currently in preview, so you must set the experimental switch to ensure traces are emitted.

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Azure.Experimental.EnableActivitySource", true);
```

For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB SDK observability: Trace attributes](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/sdk-observability?tabs=dotnet#trace-attributes).

#### Metrics

The .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.

# .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) is a native data-streaming service in the cloud that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration enables you to connect to Azure Event Hubs instances from your .NET applications.

## Hosting integration

The .NET Aspire [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/event-hubs) hosting integration models the various Event Hub resources as the following types:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsResource>: Represents a top-level Azure Event Hubs resource, used for representing collections of hubs and the connection information to the underlying Azure resource.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubResource>: Represents a single Event Hub resource.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsEmulatorResource>: Represents an Azure Event Hubs emulator as a container resource.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubConsumerGroupResource>: Represents a consumer group within an Event Hub resource.

To access these types and APIs for expressing them within your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs) NuGet package:

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add an Azure Event Hubs resource

To add an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsResource> to your app host project, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubs*> method providing a name, and then call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.AddHub*>:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs");
eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you add an Azure Event Hubs resource to the app host, it exposes other useful APIs to add Event Hub resources, consumer groups, express explicit provisioning configuration, and enables the use of the Azure Event Hubs emulator. The preceding code adds an Azure Event Hubs resource named `event-hubs` and an Event Hub named `messages` to the app host project. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> method passes the connection information to the `ExampleService` project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubs*>, it implicitly calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning(Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder)>—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning: Configuration](../azure/local-provisioning.md#configuration)

#### Generated provisioning Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With .NET Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand, instead the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file. When you add an Azure Event Hubs resource, the following Bicep is generated:

:::code language="bicep" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/event-hubs.module.bicep":::

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure Event Hubs resource with the following defaults:

- `location`: The location of the resource group.
- `sku`: The SKU of the Event Hubs resource, defaults to `Standard`.
- `principalId`: The principal ID of the Event Hubs resource.
- `principalType`: The principal type of the Event Hubs resource.
- `event_hubs`: The Event Hubs namespace resource.
- `event_hubs_AzureEventHubsDataOwner`: The Event Hubs resource owner, based on the build-in `Azure Event Hubs Data Owner` role. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs Data Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/analytics#azure-event-hubs-data-owner).
- `messages`: The Event Hub resource.
- `eventHubsEndpoint`: The endpoint of the Event Hubs resource.

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly will be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they are reflected in the generated files.

#### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All .NET Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure})> API. For example, you can configure the `kind`, `consistencyPolicy`, `locations`, and more. The following example demonstrates how to customize the Azure Cosmos DB resource:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureEventHubsInfra.cs" id="configure":::

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure.GetProvisionableResources> method.
  - The single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.EventHubs.EventHubsNamespace> resource is retrieved.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.EventHubs.EventHubsNamespace.Sku?displayProperty=nameWithType> property is assigned to a new instance of <xref:Azure.Provisioning.EventHubs.EventHubsSku> with a `Premium` name and tier, and a `Capacity` of `7`.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.EventHubs.EventHubsNamespace.PublicNetworkAccess> property is assigned to `SecuredByPerimeter`.
  - A tag is added to the Event Hubs resource with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.

There are many more configuration options available to customize the Event Hubs resource resource. For more information, see <xref:Azure.Provisioning.PostgreSql>. For more information, see [`Azure.Provisioning` customization](../azure/integrations-overview.md#azureprovisioning-customization).

### Connect to an existing Azure Event Hubs namespace

You might have an existing Azure Event Hubs namespace that you want to connect to. Instead of representing a new Azure Event Hubs resource, you can add a connection string to the app host. To add a connection to an existing Azure Event Hubs namespace, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddConnectionString("event-hubs");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApplication>("web")
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

The connection string is configured in the app host's configuration, typically under [User Secrets](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets), under the `ConnectionStrings` section. The app host injects this connection string as an environment variable into all dependent resources, for example:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "event-hubs": "{your_namespace}.servicebus.windows.net"
  }
}
```

The dependent resource can access the injected connection string by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationExtensions.GetConnectionString*> method, and passing the connection name as the parameter, in this case `"event-hubs"`. The `GetConnectionString` API is shorthand for `IConfiguration.GetSection("ConnectionStrings")[name]`.

### Add Event Hub consumer group

To add a consumer group, chain a call on an `IResourceBuilder<AzureEventHubsResource>` to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.AddConsumerGroup*> API:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs");
var messages = eventHubs.AddHub("messages");
messages.AddConsumerGroup("messagesConsumer");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you call `AddConsumerGroup`, it configures your `messages` Event Hub resource to have a consumer group named `messagesConsumer`. The consumer group is created in the Azure Event Hubs namespace that's represented by the `AzureEventHubsResource` that you added earlier. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs: Consumer groups](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#consumer-groups).

### Add Azure Event Hubs emulator resource

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs hosting integration supports running the Event Hubs resource as an emulator locally, based on the `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-messaging/eventhubs-emulator/latest` container image. This is beneficial for situations where you want to run the Event Hubs resource locally for development and testing purposes, avoiding the need to provision an Azure resource or connect to an existing Azure Event Hubs server.

To run the Event Hubs resource as an emulator, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.RunAsEmulator*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator();

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

var exampleProject = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                            .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code configures an Azure Event Hubs resource to run locally in a container. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs Emulator](/azure/event-hubs/overview-emulator).

#### Configure Event Hubs emulator container

There are various configurations available for container resources, for example, you can configure the container's ports, data bind mounts, data volumes, or providing a wholistic JSON configuration which overrides everything.

##### Configure Event Hubs emulator container host port

By default, the Event Hubs emulator container when configured by .NET Aspire, exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Image | Container port | Host port |
|--|--|--|--|
| `emulator` | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-messaging/eventhubs-emulator/latest` | 5672 | dynamic |

The port that it's listening on is dynamic by default. When the container starts, the port is mapped to a random port on the host machine. To configure the endpoint port, chain calls on the container resource builder provided by the `RunAsEmulator` method and then the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.WithHostPort(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsEmulatorResource},System.Nullable{System.Int32})> as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator(emulator =>
                       {
                           emulator.WithHostPort(7777);
                       });

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code configures the Azure Event emulator container's existing `emulator` endpoint to listen on port `7777`. The Azure Event emulator container's port is mapped to the host port as shown in the following table:

| Endpoint name | Port mapping (`container:host`) |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| `emulator`    | `5672:7777`                     |

##### Add Event Hubs emulator with data volume

To add a data volume to the Event Hubs emulator resource, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.WithDataVolume*> method on the Event Hubs emulator resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator(emulator =>
                       {
                           emulator.WithDataVolume();
                       });

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The data volume is used to persist the Event Hubs emulator data outside the lifecycle of its container. The data volume is mounted at the `/data` path in the container. A name is generated at random unless you provide a set the `name` parameter. For more information on data volumes and details on why they're preferred over [bind mounts](#add-event-hubs-emulator-with-data-bind-mount), see [Docker docs: Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes).

##### Add Event Hubs emulator with data bind mount

The add a bind mount to the Event Hubs emulator container, chain a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.WithDataBindMount*> API, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator(emulator =>
                       {
                           emulator.WithDataBindMount("/path/to/data");
                       });

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [data-bind-mount-vs-volumes](../includes/data-bind-mount-vs-volumes.md)]

Data bind mounts rely on the host machine's filesystem to persist the Azure Event Hubs emulator resource data across container restarts. The data bind mount is mounted at the `/path/to/data` path on the host machine in the container. For more information on data bind mounts, see [Docker docs: Bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts).

##### Configure Event Hubs emulator container JSON configuration

The Event Hubs emulator container runs with a default [_config.json_](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-emulator-installer/blob/main/EventHub-Emulator/Config/Config.json) file. You can override this file entirely, or update the JSON configuration with a <xref:System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonNode> representation of the configuration.

To provide a custom JSON configuration file, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.WithConfigurationFile(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsEmulatorResource},System.String)> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator(emulator =>
                       {
                           emulator.WithConfigurationFile("./messaging/custom-config.json");
                       });

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code configures the Event Hubs emulator container to use a custom JSON configuration file located at `./messaging/custom-config.json`. This will be mounted at the `/Eventhubs_Emulator/ConfigFiles/Config.json` path on the container, as a read-only file. To instead override specific properties in the default configuration, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureEventHubsExtensions.WithConfiguration(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureEventHubsEmulatorResource},System.Action{System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonNode})> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var eventHubs = builder.AddAzureEventHubs("event-hubs")
                       .RunAsEmulator(emulator =>
                       {
                           emulator.WithConfiguration(
                               (JsonNode configuration) =>
                               {
                                   var userConfig = configuration["UserConfig"];
                                   var ns = userConfig["NamespaceConfig"][0];
                                   var firstEntity = ns["Entities"][0];
                                   
                                   firstEntity["PartitionCount"] = 5;
                               });
                       });

eventHubs.AddHub("messages");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleService>()
       .WithReference(eventHubs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code retrieves the `UserConfig` node from the default configuration. It then updates the first entity's `PartitionCount` to a `5`.

### Hosting integration health checks

The Azure Event Hubs hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the Event Hubs resource. The health check verifies that the Event Hubs is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [📦 AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs) NuGet package.

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Event Hubs client.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

### Supported Event Hubs client types

The following Event Hub clients are supported by the library, along with their corresponding options and settings classes:

| Azure client type | Azure options class | .NET Aspire settings class |
|--|--|--|
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubProducerClient> | <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubProducerClientOptions> | <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsProducerSettings> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubBufferedProducerClient> | <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubBufferedProducerClientOptions> | <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsBufferedProducerSettings> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer.EventHubConsumerClient> | <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer.EventHubConsumerClientOptions> | <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsConsumerSettings> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClient> | <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClientOptions> | <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsProcessorSettings> |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.PartitionReceiver> | <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Primitives.PartitionReceiverOptions> | <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsPartitionReceiverSettings> |

The client types are from the Azure SDK for .NET, as are the corresponding options classes. The settings classes are provided by the .NET Aspire. The settings classes are used to configure the client instances.

### Add an Event Hubs producer client

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your client-consuming project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient*> extension method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register an <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubProducerClient> for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient(connectionName: "event-hubs");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Event Hubs resource in the app host project. For more information, see [Add an Azure Event Hubs resource](#add-an-azure-event-hubs-resource).

After adding the `EventHubProducerClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve your data source object from an example service define it as a constructor parameter and ensure the `ExampleService` class is registered with the dependency injection container:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(EventHubProducerClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information, see:

- [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/README.md) for examples on using the `EventHubProducerClient`.
- [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.

#### Additional APIs to consider

The client integration provides additional APIs to configure client instances. When you need to register an Event Hubs client, consider the following APIs:

| Azure client type | Registration API |
|--|--|
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubProducerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubBufferedProducerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubBufferedProducerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer.EventHubConsumerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventHubConsumerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzureEventProcessorClient*> |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.PartitionReceiver> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddAzurePartitionReceiverClient*> |

All of the aforementioned APIs include optional parameters to configure the client instances.

### Add keyed Event Hubs producer client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `EventHubProducerClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Event Hubs clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireServiceBusExtensions.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient(name: "messages");
builder.AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient(name: "commands");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Event Hubs resource configured two named hubs, one for the `messages` and one for the `commands`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("messages")] EventHubProducerClient messagesClient,
    [KeyedService("commands")] EventHubProducerClient commandsClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

#### Additional keyed APIs to consider

The client integration provides additional APIs to configure keyed client instances. When you need to register a keyed Event Hubs client, consider the following APIs:

| Azure client type | Registration API |
|--|--|
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubProducerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer.EventHubBufferedProducerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddKeyedAzureEventHubBufferedProducerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer.EventHubConsumerClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddKeyedAzureEventHubConsumerClient*> |
| <xref:Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClient> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddKeyedAzureEventProcessorClient*> |
| <xref:Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.PartitionReceiver> | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireEventHubsExtensions.AddKeyedAzurePartitionReceiverClient*> |

All of the aforementioned APIs include optional parameters to configure the client instances.

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs library provides multiple options to configure the Azure Event Hubs connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project. Either a `FullyQualifiedNamespace` or a `ConnectionString` is a required to be supplied.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient()` and other supported Event Hubs clients. In this example, the connection string does not include the `EntityPath` property, so the `EventHubName` property must be set in the settings callback:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient(
    "event-hubs",
    static settings =>
    {
        settings.EventHubName = "MyHub";
    });
```

And then the connection information will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section. Two connection formats are supported:

##### Fully Qualified Namespace (FQN)

The recommended approach is to use a fully qualified namespace, which works with the <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.AzureMessagingEventHubsSettings.Credential?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to establish a connection. If no credential is configured, the <xref:Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential> is used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "event-hubs": "{your_namespace}.servicebus.windows.net"
  }
}
```

#### Connection string

Alternatively, use a connection string:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "event-hubs": "Endpoint=sb://mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=accesskeyname;SharedAccessKey=accesskey;EntityPath=MyHub"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs library supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration?displayProperty=fullName>. It loads the `AzureMessagingEventHubsSettings` and the associated Options, e.g. `EventProcessorClientOptions`, from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:Messaging:EventHubs:` key prefix, followed by the name of the specific client in use. For example, consider the _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ that configures some of the options for an `EventProcessorClient`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "EventHubs": {
          "EventProcessorClient": {
            "EventHubName": "MyHub",
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Identifier": "PROCESSOR_ID"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Azure Event Hubs client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ConfigurationSchema.json).

You can also setup the Options type using the optional `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<EventProcessorClient, EventProcessorClientOptions>> configureClientBuilder` parameter of the `AddAzureEventProcessorClient` method. For example, to set the processor's client ID for this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventProcessorClient(
    "event-hubs",
    configureClientBuilder: clientBuilder => clientBuilder.ConfigureOptions(
        options => options.Identifier = "PROCESSOR_ID"));
```

### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.*`

### Metrics

The .NET Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK for .NET. If that changes in the future, this section will be updated to reflect those changes.

# .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration enables you to connect to Azure Service Bus instances from .NET applications.

## Hosting integration

The .NET Aspire [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) hosting integration models the various Service Bus resources as the following types:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusResource>: Represents an Azure Service Bus resource.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusEmulatorResource>: Represents an Azure Service Bus emulator resource.

To access these types and APIs for expressing them, add the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus) NuGet package in the [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add Azure Service Bus resource

In your app host project, call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddAzureServiceBus*> to add and return an Azure Service Bus resource builder.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you add an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusResource> to the app host, it exposes other useful APIs to add queues and topics. In other words, you must add an `AzureServiceBusResource` before adding any of the other Service Bus resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddAzureServiceBus*>, it implicitly calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning*>—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Configuration](../azure/local-provisioning.md#configuration).

#### Generated provisioning Bicep

If you're new to Bicep, it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With .NET Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand, instead the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file. When you add an Azure Service Bus resource, the following Bicep is generated:

:::code language="bicep" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/service-bus.module.bicep":::

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure Service Bus namespace with the following defaults:

- `sku`: The SKU of the Service Bus namespace. The default is Standard.
- `location`: The location for the Service Bus namespace. The default is the resource group's location.

In addition to the Service Bus namespace, it also provisions an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) built-in role of Azure Service Bus Data Owner. The role is assigned to the Service Bus namespace's resource group. For more information, see [Azure Service Bus Data Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/integration#azure-service-bus-data-owner).

#### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All .NET Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure})> API. For example, you can configure the sku, location, and more. The following example demonstrates how to customize the Azure Service Bus resource:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureServiceBusInfra.cs" id="configure":::

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> API:
  - The infra parameter is an instance of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure.GetProvisionableResources> method.
  - The single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ServiceBus.ServiceBusNamespace> is retrieved.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ServiceBus.ServiceBusNamespace.Sku?displayProperty=nameWithType> created with a <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ServiceBus.ServiceBusSkuTier.Premium?displayProperty=nameWithType>
  - A tag is added to the Service Bus namespace with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.

There are many more configuration options available to customize the Azure Service Bus resource. For more information, see <xref:Azure.Provisioning.ServiceBus>. For more information, see [Azure.Provisioning customization](../azure/integrations-overview.md#azureprovisioning-customization).

### Connect to an existing Azure Service Bus namespace

You might have an existing Azure Service Bus namespace that you want to connect to. Instead of representing a new Azure Service Bus resource, you can add a connection string to the app host. To add a connection to an existing Azure Service Bus namespace, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddConnectionString("messaging");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApplication>("web")
       .WithReference(serviceBus);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

The connection string is configured in the app host's configuration, typically under [User Secrets](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets), under the `ConnectionStrings` section. The app host injects this connection string as an environment variable into all dependent resources, for example:

```json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "messaging": "Endpoint=sb://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={key_name};SharedAccessKey={key_value};"
    }
}
```

The dependent resource can access the injected connection string by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationExtensions.GetConnectionString*> method, and passing the connection name as the parameter, in this case `"messaging"`. The `GetConnectionString` API is shorthand for `IConfiguration.GetSection("ConnectionStrings")[name]`.

### Add Azure Service Bus queue

To add an Azure Service Bus queue, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddServiceBusQueue*> method on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureServiceBusResource>`:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");
serviceBus.AddServiceBusQueue("queue");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddServiceBusQueue(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusResource},System.String,System.String)>, it configures your Service Bus resources to have a queue named `queue`. The queue is created in the Service Bus namespace that's represented by the `AzureServiceBusResource` that you added earlier. For more information, see [Queues, topics, and subscriptions in Azure Service Bus](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions).

### Add Azure Service Bus topic and subscription

To add an Azure Service Bus topic, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddServiceBusTopic*> method on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureServiceBusResource>`:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");
serviceBus.AddServiceBusTopic("topic");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddServiceBusTopic(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusResource},System.String,System.String)>, it configures your Service Bus resources to have a topic named `topic`. The topic is created in the Service Bus namespace that's represented by the `AzureServiceBusResource` that you added earlier.

To add a subscription for the topic, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.AddServiceBusSubscription*> method on the `IResourceBuilder<AzureServiceBusTopicResource>` and configure it using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.WithProperties*> method:

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.Azure;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");
var topic = serviceBus.AddServiceBusTopic("topic");
topic.AddServiceBusSubscription("sub1")
     .WithProperties(subscription =>
     {
         subscription.MaxDeliveryCount = 10;
         subscription.Rules.Add(
             new AzureServiceBusRule("app-prop-filter-1")
             {
                 CorrelationFilter = new()
                 {
                     ContentType = "application/text",
                     CorrelationId = "id1",
                     Subject = "subject1",
                     MessageId = "msgid1",
                     ReplyTo = "someQueue",
                     ReplyToSessionId = "sessionId",
                     SessionId = "session1",
                     SendTo = "xyz"
                 }
             });
     });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code not only adds a topic and creates and configures a subscription named `sub1` for the topic. The subscription has a maximum delivery count of `10` and a rule named `app-prop-filter-1`. The rule is a correlation filter that filters messages based on the `ContentType`, `CorrelationId`, `Subject`, `MessageId`, `ReplyTo`, `ReplyToSessionId`, `SessionId`, and `SendTo` properties.

For more information, see [Queues, topics, and subscriptions in Azure Service Bus](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions).

### Add Azure Service Bus emulator resource

To add an Azure Service Bus emulator resource, chain a call on an `<IResourceBuilder<AzureServiceBusResource>>` to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.RunAsEmulator*> API:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging")
                        .RunAsEmulator();

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When you call `RunAsEmulator`, it configures your Service Bus resources to run locally using an emulator. The emulator in this case is the [Azure Service Bus Emulator](/azure/service-bus-messaging/overview-emulator). The Azure Service Bus Emulator provides a free local environment for testing your Azure Service Bus apps and it's a perfect companion to the .NET Aspire Azure hosting integration. The emulator isn't installed, instead, it's accessible to .NET Aspire as a container. When you add a container to the app host, as shown in the preceding example with the `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-messaging/servicebus-emulator` image (and the companion `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge` image), it creates and starts the container when the app host starts. For more information, see [Container resource lifecycle](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#container-resource-lifecycle).

#### Configure Service Bus emulator container

There are various configurations available for container resources, for example, you can configure the container's ports or providing a wholistic JSON configuration which overrides everything.

##### Configure Service Bus emulator container host port

By default, the Service Bus emulator container when configured by .NET Aspire, exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Image | Container port | Host port |
|--|--|--|--|
| `emulator` | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-messaging/servicebus-emulator` | 5672 | dynamic |
| `tcp` | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge` | 1433 | dynamic |

The port that it's listening on is dynamic by default. When the container starts, the port is mapped to a random port on the host machine. To configure the endpoint port, chain calls on the container resource builder provided by the `RunAsEmulator` method and then the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.WithHostPort(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusEmulatorResource},System.Nullable{System.Int32})> as shown in the following example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging").RunAsEmulator(
                         emulator =>
                         {
                             emulator.WithHostPort(7777);
                         });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code configures the Service Bus emulator container's existing `emulator` endpoint to listen on port `7777`. The Service Bus emulator container's port is mapped to the host port as shown in the following table:

| Endpoint name | Port mapping (`container:host`) |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| `emulator`    | `5672:7777`                     |

##### Configure Service Bus emulator container JSON configuration

The Service Bus emulator automatically generates a configration similar to this [_config.json_](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-emulator-installer/blob/main/ServiceBus-Emulator/Config/Config.json) file from the configured resources. You can override this generated file entirely, or update the JSON configuration with a <xref:System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonNode> representation of the configuration.

To provide a custom JSON configuration file, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.WithConfigurationFile(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusEmulatorResource},System.String)> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging").RunAsEmulator(
                         emulator =>
                         {
                             emulator.WithConfigurationFile(
                                 path: "./messaging/custom-config.json");
                         });
```

The preceding code configures the Service Bus emulator container to use a custom JSON configuration file located at `./messaging/custom-config.json`. To instead override specific properties in the default configuration, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureServiceBusExtensions.WithConfiguration(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureServiceBusEmulatorResource},System.Action{System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonNode})> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging").RunAsEmulator(
                         emulator =>
                         {
                             emulator.WithConfiguration(
                                 (JsonNode configuration) =>
                                 {
                                     var userConfig = configuration["UserConfig"];
                                     var ns = userConfig["Namespaces"][0];
                                     var firstQueue = ns["Queues"][0];
                                     var properties = firstQueue["Properties"];
                                     
                                     properties["MaxDeliveryCount"] = 5;
                                     properties["RequiresDuplicateDetection"] = true;
                                     properties["DefaultMessageTimeToLive"] = "PT2H";
                                 });
                         });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code retrieves the `UserConfig` node from the default configuration. It then updates the first queue's properties to set the `MaxDeliveryCount` to `5`, `RequiresDuplicateDetection` to `true`, and `DefaultMessageTimeToLive` to `2 hours`.

### Hosting integration health checks

The Azure Service Bus hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the Service Bus resource. The health check verifies that the Service Bus is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [📦 AspNetCore.HealthChecks.AzureServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.AzureServiceBus) NuGet package.

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Service Bus client. The Service Bus client integration registers a <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClient> instance that you can use to interact with Service Bus.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

### Add Service Bus client

In the :::no-loc text="Program.cs"::: file of your client-consuming project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireServiceBusExtensions.AddAzureServiceBusClient*> extension method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register a <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClient> for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(connectionName: "messaging");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Service Bus resource in the app host project. In other words, when you call `AddAzureServiceBus` and provide a name of `messaging` that same name should be used when calling `AddAzureServiceBusClient`. For more information, see [Add Azure Service Bus resource](#add-azure-service-bus-resource).

You can then retrieve the <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClient> instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(ServiceBusClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information on dependency injection, see [.NET dependency injection](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection).

### Add keyed Service Bus client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `ServiceBusClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Service Bus clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireServiceBusExtensions.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient(name: "mainBus");
builder.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient(name: "loggingBus");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Service Bus resource configured two named buses, one for the `mainBus` and one for the `loggingBus`.

Then you can retrieve the `ServiceBusClient` instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("mainBus")] ServiceBusClient mainBusClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("loggingBus")] ServiceBusClient loggingBusClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration provides multiple options to configure the connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireServiceBusExtensions.AddAzureServiceBusClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient("messaging");
```

Then the connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "messaging": "Endpoint=sb://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={keyName};SharedAccessKey={key};"
  }
}
```

For more information on how to format this connection string, see the ConnectionString documentation.

#### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration>. It loads the <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.AzureMessagingServiceBusSettings> from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:Messaging:ServiceBus` key. The following snippet is an example of a :::no-loc text="appsettings.json"::: file that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "ServiceBus": {
          "ConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={keyName};SharedAccessKey={key};",
          "DisableTracing": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Service Bus client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/ConfigurationSchema.json).

#### Use inline delegates

Also you can pass the `Action<AzureMessagingServiceBusSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

You can also set up the <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClientOptions?displayProperty=fullName> using the optional `Action<ServiceBusClientOptions> configureClientOptions` parameter of the `AddAzureServiceBusClient` method. For example to set the <xref:Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.ServiceBusClientOptions.Identifier?displayProperty=nameWithType> user-agent header suffix for all requests issues by this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => clientOptions.Identifier = "myapp");
```

### Client integration health checks

By default, .NET Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. For more information, see [.NET Aspire integrations overview](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md).

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration:

- Adds the health check when <xref:Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.AzureMessagingServiceBusSettings.DisableTracing?displayProperty=nameWithType> is `false`, which attempts to connect to the Service Bus.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic.

[!INCLUDE [integration-observability-and-telemetry](../includes/integration-observability-and-telemetry.md)]

#### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`
- `Azure-Messaging-ServiceBus`

In addition to getting Azure Service Bus request diagnostics for failed requests, you can configure latency thresholds to determine which successful Azure Service Bus request diagnostics will be logged. The default values are 100 ms for point operations and 500 ms for non point operations.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => {
            clientOptions.ServiceBusClientTelemetryOptions = new()
            {
                ServiceBusThresholdOptions = new()
                {
                    PointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50),
                    NonPointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300)
                }
            };
        });
```

#### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Message`
- `ServiceBusSender.Send`
- `ServiceBusSender.Schedule`
- `ServiceBusSender.Cancel`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Receive`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.ReceiveDeferred`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Peek`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Abandon`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Complete`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.DeadLetter`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Defer`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.RenewMessageLock`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.RenewSessionLock`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.GetSessionState`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.SetSessionState`
- `ServiceBusProcessor.ProcessMessage`
- `ServiceBusSessionProcessor.ProcessSessionMessage`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.CreateRule`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.DeleteRule`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.GetRules`

Azure Service Bus tracing is currently in preview, so you must set the experimental switch to ensure traces are emitted.

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Azure.Experimental.EnableActivitySource", true);
```

For more information, see [Azure Service Bus: Distributed tracing and correlation through Service Bus messaging](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-end-to-end-tracing).

#### Metrics

The .NET Aspire Azure Service Bus integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.

# .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI integration (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service) provides access to OpenAI's powerful language and embedding models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI integration enables you to connect to Azure OpenAI Service or OpenAI's API from your .NET applications.

## Hosting integration

The .NET Aspire [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/) hosting integration models Azure OpenAI resources as <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureOpenAIResource>. To access these types and APIs for expressing them within your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CognitiveServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CognitiveServices) NuGet package:

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CognitiveServices
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CognitiveServices"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add an Azure OpenAI resource

To add an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureOpenAIResource> to your app host project, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureOpenAIExtensions.AddAzureOpenAI%2A> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var openai = builder.AddAzureOpenAI("openai");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(openai);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code adds an Azure OpenAI resource named `openai` to the app host project. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> method passes the connection information to the `ExampleProject` project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureOpenAIExtensions.AddAzureOpenAI%2A>, it implicitly calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning(Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder)>—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning: Configuration](../azure/local-provisioning.md#configuration).

### Add an Azure OpenAI deployment resource

To add an Azure OpenAI deployment resource, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureOpenAIExtensions.AddDeployment(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureOpenAIResource},Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureOpenAIDeployment)> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var openai = builder.AddAzureOpenAI("openai");
openai.AddDeployment(
    new AzureOpenAIDeployment(
        name: "preview",
        modelName: "gpt-4.5-preview",
        modelVersion: "2025-02-27"));

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(openai)
       .WaitFor(openai);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code:

- Adds an Azure OpenAI resource named `openai`.
- Adds an Azure OpenAI deployment resource named `preview` with a model name of `gpt-4.5-preview`. The model name must correspond to an [available model](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) in the Azure OpenAI service.

### Generated provisioning Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With .NET Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand, instead the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep provisions an Azure OpenAI resource with standard defaults.

:::code language="bicep" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/openai.module.bicep":::

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure Cognitive Services resource with the following defaults:

- `location`: The location of the resource group.
- `principalType`: The principal type of the Cognitive Services resource.
- `principalId`: The principal ID of the Cognitive Services resource.
- `openai`: The Cognitive Services account resource.
  - `kind`: The kind of the resource, set to `OpenAI`.
  - `properties`: The properties of the resource.
    - `customSubDomainName`: The custom subdomain name for the resource, based on the unique string of the resource group ID.
    - `publicNetworkAccess`: Set to `Enabled`.
    - `disableLocalAuth`: Set to `true`.
  - `sku`: The SKU of the resource, set to `S0`.
- `openai_CognitiveServicesOpenAIContributor`: The Cognitive Services resource owner, based on the build-in `Azure Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor` role. For more information, see [Azure Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#cognitive-services-openai-contributor).
- `preview`: The deployment resource, based on the `preview` name.
  - `properties`: The properties of the deployment resource.
    - `format`: The format of the deployment resource, set to `OpenAI`.
    - `modelName`: The model name of the deployment resource, set to `gpt-4.5-preview`.
    - `modelVersion`: The model version of the deployment resource, set to `2025-02-27`.
- `connectionString`: The connection string, containing the endpoint of the Cognitive Services resource.

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly will be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they are reflected in the generated files.

### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All .NET Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type. This enables customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure})> API:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureOpenAIInfra.cs" id="configure":::

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure.GetProvisionableResources> method.
  - The single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.CognitiveServices.CognitiveServicesAccount> resource is retrieved.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.CognitiveServices.CognitiveServicesAccount.Sku?displayProperty=nameWithType> property is assigned to a new instance of <xref:Azure.Provisioning.CognitiveServices.CognitiveServicesSku> with an `E0` name and <xref:Azure.Provisioning.CognitiveServices.CognitiveServicesSkuTier.Enterprise?displayProperty=nameWithType> tier.
  - A tag is added to the Cognitive Services resource with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.

### Connect to an existing Azure OpenAI service

You might have an existing Azure OpenAI service that you want to connect to. You can chain a call to annotate that your <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AzureOpenAIResource> is an existing resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingOpenAIName = builder.AddParameter("existingOpenAIName");
var existingOpenAIResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingOpenAIResourceGroup");

var openai = builder.AddAzureOpenAI("openai")
                    .AsExisting(existingOpenAIName, existingOpenAIResourceGroup);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(openai);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

For more information on treating Azure OpenAI resources as existing resources, see [Use existing Azure resources](../azure/integrations-overview.md#use-existing-azure-resources).

Alternatively, instead of representing an Azure OpenAI resource, you can add a connection string to the app host. Which is a weakly-typed approach that's based solely on a `string` value. To add a connection to an existing Azure OpenAI service, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString%2A> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var openai = builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
    ? builder.AddAzureOpenAI("openai")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("openai");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(openai);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

The connection string is configured in the app host's configuration, typically under User Secrets, under the `ConnectionStrings` section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "openai": "https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/"
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Add existing Azure resources with connection strings](../azure/integrations-overview.md#add-existing-azure-resources-with-connection-strings).

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Azure OpenAI client.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

### Add an Azure OpenAI client

In the _Program.cs_ file of your client-consuming project, use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireAzureOpenAIExtensions.AddAzureOpenAIClient(Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder,System.String,System.Action{Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAISettings},System.Action{Azure.Core.Extensions.IAzureClientBuilder{Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAIClient,Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAIClientOptions}})> method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register an `OpenAIClient` for dependency injection (DI). The `AzureOpenAIClient` is a subclass of `OpenAIClient`, allowing you to request either type from DI. This ensures code not dependent on Azure-specific features remains generic. The `AddAzureOpenAIClient` method requires a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(connectionName: "openai");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Azure OpenAI resource in the app host project. For more information, see [Add an Azure OpenAI resource](#add-an-azure-openai-resource).

After adding the `OpenAIClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(OpenAIClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information, see:

- [Azure.AI.OpenAI documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/README.md) for examples on using the `OpenAIClient`.
- [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.
- [Quickstart: Get started using GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 with Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?pivots=programming-language-csharp).

### Add Azure OpenAI client with registered `IChatClient`

If you're interested in using the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient> interface, with the OpenAI client, simply chain either of the following APIs to the `AddAzureOpenAIClient` method:

- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireOpenAIClientBuilderChatClientExtensions.AddChatClient(Aspire.OpenAI.AspireOpenAIClientBuilder,System.String)>: Registers a singleton `IChatClient` in the services provided by the <xref:Aspire.OpenAI.AspireOpenAIClientBuilder>.
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireOpenAIClientBuilderChatClientExtensions.AddKeyedChatClient(Aspire.OpenAI.AspireOpenAIClientBuilder,System.String,System.String)>: Registers a keyed singleton `IChatClient` in the services provided by the <xref:Aspire.OpenAI.AspireOpenAIClientBuilder>.

For example, consider the following C# code that adds an `IChatClient` to the DI container:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(connectionName: "openai")
       .AddChatClient("deploymentName");
```

Similarly, you can add a keyed `IChatClient` with the following C# code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(connectionName: "openai")
       .AddKeyedChatClient("serviceKey", "deploymentName");
```

For more information on the `IChatClient` and its corresponding library, see [Artificial intelligence in .NET (Preview)](/dotnet/core/extensions/artificial-intelligence).

### Configure Azure OpenAI client settings

The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI library provides a set of settings to configure the Azure OpenAI client. The  `AddAzureOpenAIClient` method exposes an optional `configureSettings` parameter of type `Action<AzureOpenAISettings>?`. To configure settings inline, consider the following example:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(
    connectionName: "openai",
    configureSettings: settings =>
    {
        settings.DisableTracing = true;

        var uriString = builder.Configuration["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT is not set.");

        settings.Endpoint = new Uri(uriString);
    });
```

The preceding code sets the <xref:Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAISettings.DisableTracing?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to `true`, and sets the <xref:Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAISettings.Endpoint?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to the Azure OpenAI endpoint.

### Configure Azure OpenAI client builder options

To configure the <xref:Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAIClientOptions> for the client, you can use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireAzureOpenAIExtensions.AddAzureOpenAIClient%2A> method. This method takes an optional `configureClientBuilder` parameter of type `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<OpenAIClient, AzureOpenAIClientOptions>>?`. Consider the following example:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(
    connectionName: "openai",
    configureClientBuilder: clientBuilder =>
    {
        clientBuilder.ConfigureOptions(options =>
        {
            options.UserAgentApplicationId = "CLIENT_ID";
        });
    });
```

The client builder is an instance of the <xref:Azure.Core.Extensions.IAzureClientBuilder`2> type, which provides a fluent API to configure the client options. The preceding code sets the <xref:Azure.AI.OpenAI.AzureOpenAIClientOptions.UserAgentApplicationId?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to `CLIENT_ID`. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ConfigureOptionsChatClientBuilderExtensions.ConfigureOptions(Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ChatClientBuilder,System.Action{Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ChatOptions})>.

### Add Azure OpenAI client from configuration

Additionally, the package provides the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireConfigurableOpenAIExtensions.AddOpenAIClientFromConfiguration(Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder,System.String)> extension method to register an `OpenAIClient` or `AzureOpenAIClient` instance based on the provided connection string. This method follows these rules:

- If the `Endpoint` attribute is empty or missing, an `OpenAIClient` instance is registered using the provided key, for example, `Key={key};`.
- If the `IsAzure` attribute is `true`, an `AzureOpenAIClient` is registered; otherwise, an `OpenAIClient` is registered, for example, `Endpoint={azure_endpoint};Key={key};IsAzure=true` registers an `AzureOpenAIClient`, while `Endpoint=https://localhost:18889;Key={key}` registers an `OpenAIClient`.
- If the `Endpoint` attribute contains `".azure."`, an `AzureOpenAIClient` is registered; otherwise, an `OpenAIClient` is registered, for example, `Endpoint=https://{account}.azure.com;Key={key};`.

Consider the following example:

```csharp
builder.AddOpenAIClientFromConfiguration("openai");
```

> [!TIP]
> A valid connection string must contain at least an `Endpoint` or a `Key`.

Consider the following example connection strings and whether they register an `OpenAIClient` or `AzureOpenAIClient`:

| Example connection string | Registered client type |
|--|--|
| `Endpoint=https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/;Key={account_key}` | `AzureOpenAIClient` |
| `Endpoint=https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/;Key={account_key};IsAzure=false` | `OpenAIClient` |
| `Endpoint=https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/;Key={account_key};IsAzure=true` | `AzureOpenAIClient` |
| `Endpoint=https://localhost:18889;Key={account_key}` | `OpenAIClient` |

### Add keyed Azure OpenAI clients

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `OpenAIClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Azure OpenAI clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireAzureOpenAIExtensions.AddKeyedAzureOpenAIClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureOpenAIClient(name: "chat");
builder.AddKeyedAzureOpenAIClient(name: "code");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, ensure that your Azure OpenAI resource configures two named connections, one for `chat` and one for `code`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("chat")] OpenAIClient chatClient,
    [KeyedService("code")] OpenAIClient codeClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Add keyed Azure OpenAI clients from configuration

The same functionality and rules exist for keyed Azure OpenAI clients as for the nonkeyed clients. You can use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireConfigurableOpenAIExtensions.AddKeyedOpenAIClientFromConfiguration(Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder,System.String)> extension method to register an `OpenAIClient` or `AzureOpenAIClient` instance based on the provided connection string.

Consider the following example:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedOpenAIClientFromConfiguration("openai");
```

This method follows the same rules as detailed in the [Add Azure OpenAI client from configuration](#add-azure-openai-client-from-configuration).

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI library provides multiple options to configure the Azure OpenAI connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project. Either a `Endpoint` or a `ConnectionString` is required to be supplied.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient("openai");
```

The connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, and there are two supported formats:

##### Account endpoint

The recommended approach is to use an **Endpoint**, which works with the `AzureOpenAISettings.Credential` property to establish a connection. If no credential is configured, the <xref:Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential> is used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "openai": "https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/"
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Use Azure OpenAI without keys](/azure/developer/ai/keyless-connections?tabs=csharp%2Cazure-cli).

##### Connection string

Alternatively, a custom connection string can be used:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "openai": "Endpoint=https://{account_name}.openai.azure.com/;Key={account_key};"
  }
}
```

In order to connect to the non-Azure OpenAI service, drop the `Endpoint` property and only set the Key property to set the [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

#### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI integration supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration>. It loads the `AzureOpenAISettings` from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:AI:OpenAI` key. Example _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "AI": {
        "OpenAI": {
          "DisableTracing": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Azure OpenAI client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI/ConfigurationSchema.json).

#### Use inline delegates

You can pass the `Action<AzureOpenAISettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(
    "openai",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

You can also set up the OpenAIClientOptions using the optional `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<OpenAIClient, OpenAIClientOptions>> configureClientBuilder` parameter of the `AddAzureOpenAIClient` method. For example, to set the client ID for this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(
    "openai",
    configureClientBuilder: builder => builder.ConfigureOptions(
        options => options.Diagnostics.ApplicationId = "CLIENT_ID"));
```

[!INCLUDE [integration-observability-and-telemetry](../includes/integration-observability-and-telemetry.md)]

### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure`
- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure OpenAI integration emits tracing activities using OpenTelemetry for operations performed with the `OpenAIClient`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tracing is currently experimental with this integration. To opt-in to it, set either the `OPENAI_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_OPEN_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `true` or `1`, or call `AppContext.SetSwitch("OpenAI.Experimental.EnableOpenTelemetry", true))` during app startup.

# .NET Aspire Azure AI Search integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents integration enables you to connect to [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) (formerly Azure Cognitive Search) services from your .NET applications. Azure AI Search is an enterprise-ready information retrieval system for your heterogeneous content that you ingest into a search index, and surface to users through queries and apps. It comes with a comprehensive set of advanced search technologies, built for high-performance applications at any scale.

## Hosting integration

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search hosting integration models the Azure AI Search resource as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureSearchResource> type. To access this type and APIs for expressing them within your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Search](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Search) NuGet package:

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Search
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Search"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add an Azure AI Search resource

To add an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureSearchResource> to your app host project, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSearchExtensions.AddAzureSearch*> method providing a name:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var search = builder.AddAzureSearch("search");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(search);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code adds an Azure AI Search resource named `search` to the app host project. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference*> method passes the connection information to the `ExampleProject` project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureSearchExtensions.AddAzureSearch*>, it implicitly calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisionerExtensions.AddAzureProvisioning(Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder)>—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see Local provisioning: Configuration

#### Generated provisioning Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With .NET Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by hand; instead, the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file. When you add an Azure AI Search resource, Bicep is generated to provision the search service with appropriate defaults.

:::code language="bicep" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/search.module.bicep":::

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure AI Search service resource with the following defaults:

- `location`: The location parameter of the resource group, defaults to `resourceGroup().location`.
- `principalType`: The principal type parameter of the Azure AI Search resource.
- `principalId`: The principal ID  parameter of the Azure AI Search resource.
- `search`: The resource representing the Azure AI Search service.
  - `properties`: The properties of the Azure AI Search service:
    - `hostingMode`: Is set to `default`.
    - `disableLocalAuth`: Is set to `true`.
    - `partitionCount`: Is set to `1`.
    - `replicaCount`: Is set to `1`.
  - `sku`: Defaults to `basic`.
- `search_SearchIndexDataContributor`: The role assignment for the Azure AI Search index data contributor role. For more information, see [Search Index Data Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#search-index-data-contributor).
- `search_SearchServiceContributor`: The role assignment for the Azure AI Search service contributor role. For more information, see [Search Service Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#search-service-contributor).
- `connectionString`: The connection string for the Azure AI Search service, which is used to connect to the service. The connection string is generated using the `Endpoint` property of the Azure AI Search service.

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly will be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they are reflected in the generated files.

#### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All .NET Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure})> API. For example, you can configure the search service partitions, replicas, and more:

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureSearchInfra.cs" id="configure":::

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure.GetProvisionableResources> method.
  - The single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Search.SearchService> resource is retrieved.
    - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Search.SearchService.PartitionCount?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to `6`.
    - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Search.SearchService.ReplicaCount?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to `3`.
    - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Search.SearchService.SearchSkuName?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Search.SearchServiceSkuName.Standard3?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
    - A tag is added to the Cognitive Services resource with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.

There are many more configuration options available to customize the Azure AI Search resource. For more information, see [`Azure.Provisioning` customization](../azure/integrations-overview.md#azureprovisioning-customization).

### Connect to an existing Azure AI Search service

You might have an existing Azure AI Search service that you want to connect to. You can chain a call to annotate that your <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureSearchResource> is an existing resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingSearchName = builder.AddParameter("existingSearchName");
var existingSearchResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingSearchResourceGroup");

var search = builder.AddAzureSearch("search")
                    .AsExisting(existingSearchName, existingSearchResourceGroup);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(search);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

For more information on treating Azure AI Search resources as existing resources, see [Use existing Azure resources](../azure/integrations-overview.md#use-existing-azure-resources).

Alternatively, instead of representing an Azure AI Search resource, you can add a connection string to the app host. Which is a weakly-typed approach that's based solely on a `string` value. To add a connection to an existing Azure AI Search service, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString%2A> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var search = builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
    ? builder.AddAzureSearch("search")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("search");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(search);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [connection-strings-alert](../includes/connection-strings-alert.md)]

The connection string is configured in the app host's configuration, typically under User Secrets, under the `ConnectionStrings` section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "search": "https://{account_name}.search.azure.com/"
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Add existing Azure resources with connection strings](../azure/integrations-overview.md#add-existing-azure-resources-with-connection-strings).

### Hosting integration health checks

The Azure AI Search hosting integration doesn't currently implement any health checks. This limitation is subject to change in future releases. As always, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues) if you have any suggestions or feedback.

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Azure AI Search Documents client.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

### Add an Azure AI Search index client

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your client-consuming project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireAzureSearchExtensions.AddAzureSearchClient*> extension method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register a <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Search.SearchIndexClient> for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureSearchClient(connectionName: "search");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Azure AI Search resource in the app host project. For more information, see [Add an Azure AI Search resource](#add-an-azure-ai-search-resource).

After adding the `SearchIndexClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the client instance from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(SearchIndexClient indexClient)
{
    // Use indexClient
}
```

You can also retrieve a `SearchClient` which can be used for querying, by calling the <xref:Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes.SearchIndexClient.GetSearchClient(System.String)> method:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(SearchIndexClient indexClient)
{
    public async Task<long> GetDocumentCountAsync(
        string indexName,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var searchClient = indexClient.GetSearchClient(indexName);

        var documentCountResponse = await searchClient.GetDocumentCountAsync(
            cancellationToken);

        return documentCountResponse.Value;
    }
}
```

For more information, see:

- Azure AI Search client library for .NET [samples using the `SearchIndexClient`](/azure/search/samples-dotnet).
- [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.

### Add keyed Azure AI Search index client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `SearchIndexClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Azure AI Search clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireAzureSearchExtensions.AddKeyedAzureSearchClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureSearchClient(name: "images");
builder.AddKeyedAzureSearchClient(name: "documents");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Azure AI Search resource configured two named connections, one for the `images` and one for the `documents`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("images")] SearchIndexClient imagesClient,
    [KeyedService("documents")] SearchIndexClient documentsClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents library provides multiple options to configure the Azure AI Search connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project. Either an `Endpoint` or a `ConnectionString` is required to be supplied.

#### Use a connection string

A connection can be constructed from the **Keys and Endpoint** tab with the format `Endpoint={endpoint};Key={key};`. You can provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddAzureSearchClient()`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureSearchClient("searchConnectionName");
```

The connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section. Two connection formats are supported:

##### Account endpoint

The recommended approach is to use an `Endpoint`, which works with the `AzureSearchSettings.Credential` property to establish a connection. If no credential is configured, the <xref:Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential> is used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "search": "https://{search_service}.search.windows.net/"
  }
}
```

##### Connection string

Alternatively, a connection string with key can be used, however; it's not the recommended approach:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "search": "Endpoint=https://{search_service}.search.windows.net/;Key={account_key};"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search library supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration?displayProperty=fullName>. It loads the `AzureSearchSettings` and `SearchClientOptions` from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:Search:Documents` key. Example _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Search": {
        "Documents": {
          "DisableTracing": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Azure AI Search Documents client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.Search.Documents/ConfigurationSchema.json).

### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<AzureSearchSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureSearchClient(
    "searchConnectionName",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

You can also set up the <xref:Azure.Search.Documents.SearchClientOptions> using the optional `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<SearchIndexClient, SearchClientOptions>> configureClientBuilder` parameter of the `AddAzureSearchClient` method. For example, to set the client ID for this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureSearchClient(
    "searchConnectionName",
    configureClientBuilder: builder => builder.ConfigureOptions(
        static options => options.Diagnostics.ApplicationId = "CLIENT_ID"));
```

[!INCLUDE [client-integration-health-checks](../includes/client-integration-health-checks.md)]

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents integration implements a single health check that calls the <xref:Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes.SearchIndexClient.GetServiceStatisticsAsync%2A> method on the `SearchIndexClient` to verify that the service is available.

[!INCLUDE [integration-observability-and-telemetry](../includes/integration-observability-and-telemetry.md)]

### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure`
- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure AI Search Documents integration emits tracing activities using OpenTelemetry when interacting with the search service.

# .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting](../includes/includes-hosting.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration is currently in preview and is subject to change.

[Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. The .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration enables you to develop, debug, and orchestrate an Azure Functions .NET project as part of the app host.

It's expected that you've installed the required Azure tooling:

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

- [Configure Visual Studio for Azure development with .NET](/dotnet/azure/configure-visual-studio)

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="vscode"

- [Configure Visual Studio Code for Azure development with .NET](/dotnet/azure/configure-vs-code)

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="dotnet-cli"

- [Install the Azure Functions Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=isolated-process&pivots=programming-language-csharp#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)

:::zone-end

## Supported scenarios

The .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration has several key supported scenarios. This section outlines the scenarios and provides details related to the implementation of each approach.

### Supported triggers

The following table lists the supported triggers for Azure Functions in the .NET Aspire integration:

| Trigger | Attribute | Details |
|--|--|--|
| Azure Event Hubs trigger | `EventHubTrigger` | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs) |
| Azure Service Bus trigger | `ServiceBusTrigger` | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus) |
| Azure Storage Blobs trigger | `BlobTrigger` | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage) |
| Azure Storage Queues trigger | `QueueTrigger` | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage) |
| Azure CosmosDB trigger | `CosmosDbTrigger` | [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CosmosDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CosmosDB) |
| HTTP trigger | `HttpTrigger` | Supported without any additional resource dependencies. |
| Timer trigger | `TimerTrigger` | Supported without any additional resource dependencies—relies on implicit host storage. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Other Azure Functions triggers and bindings aren't currently supported in the .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration.

### Deployment

Currently, deployment is supported only to containers on Azure Container Apps (ACA) using the SDK container publish function in `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk`. This deployment methodology doesn't currently support KEDA-based autoscaling.

#### Configure external HTTP endpoints

To make HTTP triggers publicly accessible, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExternalHttpEndpoints*> API on the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureFunctionsProjectResource>. For more information, see [Add Azure Functions resource](#add-azure-functions-resource).

## Azure Function project constraints

The .NET Aspire Azure Functions integration has the following project constraints:

- You must target .NET 8.0 or later.
- You must use a .NET 9 SDK.
- It currently only supports .NET workers with the [isolated worker model](/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide).
- Requires the following NuGet packages:
  - [📦 Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker): Use the `FunctionsApplicationBuilder`.
  - [📦 Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk): Adds support for `dotnet run` and `azd publish`.
  - [📦 Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Http.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore): Adds HTTP trigger-supporting APIs.

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

If you encounter issues with the Azure Functions project, such as:

> There is no Functions runtime available that matches the version specified in the project

In Visual Studio, try checking for an update on the Azure Functions tooling. Open the **Options** dialog, navigate to **Projects and Solutions**, and then select **Azure Functions**. Select the **Check for updates** button to ensure you have the latest version of the Azure Functions tooling:

:::image type="content" source="media/visual-studio-auzre-functions-options.png" alt-text="Visual Studio: Options / Projects and Solutions / Azure Functions.":::

:::zone-end

## Hosting integration

The Azure Functions hosting integration models an Azure Functions resource as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureFunctionsProjectResource> (subtype of <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ProjectResource>) type. To access this type and APIs that allow you to add it to your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions) NuGet package.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions --prerelease
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add Azure Functions resource

In your app host project, call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureFunctionsProjectResourceExtensions.AddAzureFunctionsProject*> on the `builder` instance to add an Azure Functions resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var functions = builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.ExampleFunctions>("functions")
                       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(functions)
       .WaitFor(functions);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When .NET Aspire adds an Azure Functions project resource the app host, as shown in the preceding example, the `functions` resource can be referenced by other project resources. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> method configures a connection in the `ExampleProject` named `"functions"`. If the Azure Resource was deployed and it exposed an HTTP trigger, its endpoint would be external due to the call to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithExternalHttpEndpoints*>. For more information, see [Reference resources](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#reference-resources).

### Add Azure Functions resource with host storage

If you want to modify the default host storage account that the Azure Functions host uses, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureFunctionsProjectResourceExtensions.WithHostStorage*> method on the Azure Functions project resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
                     .RunAsEmulator();

var functions = builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.ExampleFunctions>("functions")
                       .WithHostStorage(storage);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(functions)
       .WaitFor(functions);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code relies on the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage) NuGet package to add an Azure Storage resource that runs as an emulator. The `storage` resource is then passed to the `WithHostStorage` API, explicitly setting the host storage to the emulated resource.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not using the implicit host storage, you must manually assign the `StorageAccountContributor` role to your resource for deployed instances. This role is automatically assigned for the implicitly generated host storage.

### Reference resources in Azure Functions

To reference other Azure resources in an Azure Functions project, chain a call to `WithReference` on the Azure Functions project resource and provide the resource to reference:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage").RunAsEmulator();
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");

builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.ExampleFunctions>("functions")
       .WithHostStorage(storage)
       .WithReference(blobs);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code adds an Azure Storage resource to the app host and references it in the Azure Functions project. The `blobs` resource is added to the `storage` resource and then referenced by the `functions` resource. The connection information required to connect to the `blobs` resource is automatically injected into the Azure Functions project and enables the project to define a `BlobTrigger` that relies on `blobs` resource.

# Deploy a .NET Aspire project to Azure Container Apps

.NET Aspire projects are designed to run in containerized environments. Azure Container Apps is a fully managed environment that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. This article will walk you through creating a new .NET Aspire solution and deploying it to Microsoft Azure Container Apps using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`). You'll learn how to complete the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Provision an Azure resource group and Container Registry
> - Publish the .NET Aspire projects as container images in Azure Container Registry
> - Provision a Redis container in Azure
> - Deploy the apps to an Azure Container Apps environment
> - View application console logs to troubleshoot application issues

[!INCLUDE [aspire-prereqs](../../includes/aspire-prereqs.md)]

As an alternative to this tutorial and for a more in-depth guide, see [Deploy a .NET Aspire project to Azure Container Apps using `azd` (in-depth guide)](aca-deployment-azd-in-depth.md).

## Deploy .NET Aspire projects with `azd`

With .NET Aspire and Azure Container Apps (ACA), you have a great hosting scenario for building out your cloud-native apps with .NET. We built some great new features into the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) specific for making .NET Aspire development and deployment to Azure a friction-free experience. You can still use the Azure CLI and/or Bicep options when you need a granular level of control over your deployments. But for new projects, you won't find an easier path to success for getting a new microservice topology deployed into the cloud.

## Create a .NET Aspire project

As a starting point, this article assumes that you've created a .NET Aspire project from the **.NET Aspire Starter Application** template. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build your first .NET Aspire project](../../get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app.md).

### Resource naming

[!INCLUDE [azure-container-app-naming](../../includes/azure-container-app-naming.md)]

## Install the Azure Developer CLI

The process for installing `azd` varies based on your operating system, but it is widely available via `winget`, `brew`, `apt`, or directly via `curl`. To install `azd`, see [Install Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

title: Use .NET Aspire with Application Insights
description: Learn how to send .NET Aspire telemetry to Application Insights.
ms.date: 04/12/2024
ms.topic: how-to
---

# Use Application Insights for .NET Aspire telemetry

Azure Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, excels in Application Performance Management (APM) for live web applications. .NET Aspire projects are designed to use OpenTelemetry for application telemetry. OpenTelemetry supports an extension model to support sending data to different APMs. .NET Aspire uses OTLP by default for telemetry export, which is used by the dashboard during development. Azure Monitor doesn't (yet) support OTLP, so the applications need to be modified to use the Azure Monitor exporter, and configured with the connection string.

To use Application insights, you specify its configuration in the app host project *and* use the [Azure Monitor distro in the service defaults project](#use-the-azure-monitor-distro).

## Choosing how Application Insights is provisioned

.NET Aspire has the capability to provision cloud resources as part of cloud deployment, including Application Insights. In your .NET Aspire project, you can decide if you want .NET Aspire to provision an Application Insights resource when deploying to Azure. You can also select to use an existing Application Insights resource by providing its connection string. The connection information is managed by the resource configuration in the app host project.

### Provisioning Application insights during Azure deployment

With this option, an instance of Application Insights will be created for you when the application is deployed using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`).

To use automatic provisioning, you specify a dependency in the app host project, and reference it in each project/resource that needs to send telemetry to Application Insights. The steps include:

- Add a Nuget package reference to [Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ApplicationInsights](https://nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ApplicationInsights) in the app host project.

- Update the app host code to use the Application Insights resource, and reference it from each project:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Automatically provision an Application Insights resource
var insights = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights("MyApplicationInsights");

// Reference the resource from each project 
var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Follow the steps in [Deploy a .NET Aspire project to Azure Container Apps using the Azure Developer CLI (in-depth guide)](./aca-deployment-azd-in-depth.md) to deploy the application to Azure Container Apps. `azd` will create an Application Insights resource as part of the same resource group, and configure the connection string for each container.

### Manual provisioning of Application Insights resource

Application Insights uses a connection string to tell the OpenTelemetry exporter where to send the telemetry data. The connection string is specific to the instance of Application Insights you want to send the telemetry to. It can be found in the Overview page for the application insights instance.

:::image type="content" loc-scope="azure" source="../media/app-insights-connection-string.png" lightbox="../media/app-insights-connection-string.png" alt-text="Connection string placement in the Azure Application Insights portal UI.":::

If you wish to use an instance of Application Insights that you have provisioned manually, then you should use the `AddConnectionString` API in the app host project to tell the projects/containers where to send the telemetry data. The Azure Monitor distro expects the environment variable to be `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`, so that needs to be explicitly set when defining the connection string.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var insights = builder.AddConnectionString(
    "myInsightsResource",
    "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.Build().Run();
```

#### Resource usage during development

When running the .NET Aspire project locally, the preceding code reads the connection string from configuration. As this is a secret, you should store the value in [app secrets](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets). Right click on the app host project and choose **Manage Secrets** from the context menu to open the secrets file for the app host project. In the file add the key and your specific connection string, the example below is for illustration purposes.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "myInsightsResource": "InstrumentationKey=12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd5678;IngestionEndpoint=https://westus3-1.in.applicationinsights.azure.com"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `name` specified in the app host code needs to match a key inside the `ConnectionStrings` section in the settings file.

#### Resource usage during deployment

When [deploying an Aspire application with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](./aca-deployment-azd-in-depth.md), it will recognize the connection string resource and prompt for a value. This enables a different resource to be used for the deployment from the value used for local development.

### Mixed deployment

If you wish to use a different deployment mechanism per execution context, use the appropriate API conditionally. For example, the following code uses a pre-supplied connection at development time, and an automatically provisioned resource at deployment time.

``` csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var insights = builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
    ? builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights("myInsightsResource")
    : builder.AddConnectionString("myInsightsResource", "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WithReference(insights);

builder.Build().Run();
```

> [!TIP]
> The preceding code requires you to supply the connection string information in app secrets for development time usage, and will be prompted for the connection string by `azd` at deployment time.

## Use the Azure Monitor distro

To make exporting to Azure Monitor simpler, this example uses the Azure Monitor Exporter Repo. This is a wrapper package around the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Exporter package that makes it easier to export to Azure Monitor with a set of common defaults.

Add the following package to the `ServiceDefaults` project, so that it will be included in each of the .NET Aspire services. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](../../fundamentals/service-defaults.md).

``` xml
<PackageReference Include="Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore" 
                  Version="*" />
```

Add a using statement to the top of the project.

``` csharp
using Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore;
```

Uncomment the line in `AddOpenTelemetryExporters` to use the Azure Monitor exporter:

```csharp
private static IHostApplicationBuilder AddOpenTelemetryExporters(
    this IHostApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    // Omitted for brevity...

    // Uncomment the following lines to enable the Azure Monitor exporter 
    // (requires the Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore package)
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(builder.Configuration["APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"]))
    {
        builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry().UseAzureMonitor();
    }
    return builder;
}
```

It's possible to further customize the Azure Monitor exporter, including customizing the resource name and changing the sampling. For more information, see [Customize the Azure Monitor exporter](/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-configuration?tabs=aspnetcore). Using the parameterless version of `UseAzureMonitor()`, will pickup the connection string from the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable, we configured via the app host project.

We are excited to introduce the Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions and Microsoft.Extensions.AI libraries, available in preview today. These packages provide the .NET ecosystem with essential abstractions for integrating AI services into .NET applications and libraries, along with middleware for adding key capabilities.

To support the .NET ecosystem, the .NET team has enhanced the core Microsoft.Extensions libraries with these abstractions, or "exchange types," for .NET Generative AI applications and libraries.

AI capabilities are rapidly evolving, with common patterns emerging for functionality like "chat," embeddings, and tool calling. Unified abstractions are crucial for developers to work effectively across different sources. Middleware can add valuable functionality without burdening producers, benefiting consumers immediately.

For example, the `IChatClient` interface allows consumption of language models, whether hosted remotely or running locally. Any .NET package providing an AI client can implement this interface, enabling seamless integration with consuming .NET code.

```csharp
IChatClient client =
    environment.IsDevelopment ?
    new OllamaChatClient(...):
    new AzureAIInferenceChatClient(...);
```

Then, regardless of the provider you're using, you can send requests as follows:

```csharp
var response = await chatClient.CompleteAsync(
    "Translate the following text into Pig Latin: I love .NET and AI");

Console.WriteLine(response.Message); // (Appended from Page 2 start)
```

---

## What is Microsoft.Extensions.AI?

Microsoft.Extensions.AI is a set of core .NET libraries developed in collaboration with developers across the .NET ecosystem, including Semantic Kernel. These libraries provide a unified layer of C# abstractions for interacting with AI services, such as small and large language models (SLMs and LLMs), embeddings, and middleware.

*[Diagram showing the architecture: Application (Your .NET App leveraging AI) -> Microsoft.Extensions.AI (Support for DI, Pipelines, Middleware) -> Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions (Core Types: IChatClient, ChatMessage, Embeddings, Content Types) -> LLM Clients and AI Services (Semantic Kernel, OpenAI, Azure AI Inference, Ollama, LLM Community packages, GitHub Models - Provides an IChatClient that connects to LLM providers)]*

Currently, our focus is on creating abstractions that can be implemented by various services, all adhering to the same core concepts. We do not intend to release APIs tailored to any specific provider's services. Our goal is to act as a unifying layer within the .NET ecosystem, enabling developers to choose their preferred frameworks and libraries while ensuring seamless integration and collaboration across the ecosystem.

---

## Benefits of Microsoft.Extensions.AI

Microsoft.Extensions.AI offers a unified API abstraction for AI services, similar to our successful logging and dependency injection (DI) abstractions. Our goal is to provide standard implementations for caching, telemetry, tool calling, and other common tasks that work with any provider.

### Core benefits

*   **Unified API:** Delivers a consistent set of APIs and conventions for integrating AI services into .NET applications.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows .NET library authors to use AI services without being tied to a specific provider, making it adaptable to any provider.
*   **Ease of Use:** Enables .NET developers to experiment with different packages using the same underlying abstractions, maintaining a single API throughout their application.
*   **Componentization:** Simplifies adding new capabilities and facilitates the componentization and testing of applications.

### Common abstractions for AI Services

These abstractions make it easy to use idiomatic C# code for various scenarios with minimal code changes, whether you're using different services for development or production, addressing hybrid scenarios, or exploring other service providers.

Library authors who implement these abstractions will make their clients interoperable with the broader Microsoft.Extensions.AI ecosystem. Service-specific APIs remain accessible if needed, allowing consumers to code against the standard abstractions and pass through to proprietary APIs only when required.

```csharp
public interface IChatClient : IDisposable
{
    Task<ChatCompletion> CompleteAsync(...);
    IAsyncEnumerable<StreamingChatCompletionUpdate> CompleteStreamingAsync(...);
    ChatClientMetadata Metadata { get; }
    TService? GetService<TService>(object? key = null) where TService : class;
}
```

As of this preview, we provide reference implementations for the following services:

*   OpenAI
*   Azure AI Inference
*   Ollama

However, we intend to work with package authors across the .NET ecosystem so that implementations of these Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions end up being part of the respective client libraries rather than requiring installation of additional packages. If you have a .NET client library for a particular AI service, we would love to see implementations of these abstractions in your library.

### Standard middleware implementations

Connecting to and using AI services is just one aspect of building robust applications. Production-ready applications require additional features like telemetry, logging, and tool calling capabilities. The Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions enable developers to easily integrate these components into their applications using familiar patterns.

The following sample demonstrates how to register an OpenAI `IChatClient`. `IChatClient` allows you to attach the capabilities in a consistent way across various providers.

```csharp
app.Services.AddChatClient(builder => builder
    .UseLogging()
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .UseDistributedCache()
    .UseOpenTelemetry()
    .Use(new OpenAIClient(...)).AsChatClient(...));
```

The capabilities demonstrated above are included in the Microsoft.Extensions.AI library, but they are a small subset of the kinds of capabilities that can be layered in with this approach. We're excited to see the creativity of .NET developers shine with all types of middleware exposed for creating powerful, robust AI-related functionality.

```csharp
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

IChatClient client =
    new AzureOpenAIClient(
        new Uri(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")),
        new DefaultAzureCredential())
    .AsChatClient(modelId: "gpt-4o-mini"); // Deployment name example

var response = await client.CompleteAsync("What is AI?");
Console.WriteLine(response.Message);
```

#### Ollama

1.  Install the `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Ollama` NuGet package.
2.  Add the following code to your application.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> generator =
    new OpenAIClient(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    .AsEmbeddingGenerator(modelId: "text-embedding-3-small"); // Model ID example

var embedding = await generator.GenerateAsync("What is AI?");
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", embedding[0].Vector.ToArray()));
```

#### Azure OpenAI

1.  Install the `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI`, `Azure.AI.OpenAI`, and `Azure.Identity` NuGet packages.
2.  Add the following code to your application. Replace `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` with your Azure OpenAI endpoint and `modelId` with your deployment name.

```csharp
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> generator =
    new AzureOpenAIClient(
        new Uri(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")),
        new DefaultAzureCredential())
    .AsEmbeddingGenerator(modelId: "text-embedding-3-small"); // Deployment name example

var embeddings = await generator.GenerateAsync("What is AI?");
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", embeddings[0].Vector.ToArray()));
```

2.  Add the following code to your application.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> generator =
    new OllamaEmbeddingGenerator(new Uri("http://localhost:11434/"), "all-minilm"); // Model name example

var embedding = await generator.GenerateAsync("What is AI?");
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", embedding[0].Vector.ToArray()));
```

## Start building with Microsoft.Extensions.AI

With the release of Microsoft.Extensions.AI, we're excited to build the foundation of an ecosystem for AI application development. Here are some ways you can get involved and start building with Microsoft.Extensions.AI:

*   **Library Developers:** If you own libraries that provide clients for AI services, consider implementing the interfaces in your libraries. This allows users to easily integrate your NuGet package via the abstractions.
*   **Service Consumers:** If you're developing libraries that consume AI services, use the abstractions instead of hardcoding to a specific AI service. This approach gives your consumers the flexibility to choose their preferred service.
*   **Application Developers:** Try out the abstractions to simplify integration into your apps. This enables portability across models and services, facilitates testing and mocking, leverages middleware provided by the ecosystem, and maintains a consistent API throughout your app, even if you use different services in different parts of your application (i.e., local and hosted model hybrid scenarios).
*   **Ecosystem Contributors:** If you're interested in contributing to the ecosystem, consider writing custom middleware components.

We have a set of samples in the [dotnet/ai-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples) GitHub repository to help you get started.

For an end-to-end sample using Microsoft.Extensions.AI, see [eShopSupport](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport).

---

## What's next for Microsoft.Extensions.AI?

As mentioned, we're currently releasing Microsoft.Extensions.AI in preview. We expect the library to remain in preview through the .NET 9 release in November as we continue to gather feedback.

In the near term, we plan to:

*   Continue collaborating with Semantic Kernel on integrating Microsoft.Extensions.AI as its foundational layer. For more details, check out the following [post on the Semantic Kernel blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/semantic-kernel-dotnet-extensions-ai/). (Note: URL inferred based on context, actual URL might differ).
*   Update existing samples like eShop to use Microsoft.Extensions.AI.
*   Work with everyone across the .NET ecosystem on the adoption of Microsoft.Extensions.AI. The more providers implement the abstractions, the more consumers use it, and the more middleware components are built, the more powerful all of the pieces become.

We look forward to shaping the future of AI development in .NET with your help.

Please try out Microsoft.Extensions.AI and [share your feedback](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/issues) (Note: Feedback link inferred) so we can build the experiences that help you and your team thrive.

**Brandon Studio** (Nov 21, 2024)
Do we have documentation or API reference?

**Vaibhav Ghorpade** (Nov 13, 2024)
Could you please clarify when to use Microsoft.Extensions.AI and Semantic Kernel?

> **Aziz, Muatassim** (Nov 14, 2024)
> Apparently the answer is not clear, other than they are using the same underlying layer of objects. However Semantic Kernel is currently supporting many more models. Until I watch on .net Conf I did not knew that Semantic Kernel is opinionated. 🙂

**Devis Lucato** (Oct 23, 2024)
As someone deeply involved with Semantic Kernel as an SDK for AI apps and Kernel Memory for RAG and memory design patterns using many LLMs, it's thrilling to see features like these making their way into the broader .NET community.
This unifying layer simplifies how developers integrate AI capabilities, providing a consistent and powerful experience for AI services in .NET. Kudos to the team for making this happen!

**Amir H** (Oct 19, 2024, Edited)
This is indeed a wonderful and welcoming news!
However, I would love to see more investment into things like MLX bindings for .net, similar to what .net for iOS (Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.macOS) has been doing for UIKit to leverage the portability and cross-platform strength of C#/dotnet ecosystem while benefiting from the native hardware performance (Apple SoC).
Thanks!

**Christian** (Oct 13, 2024, Edited)
I guess that this decision is set in stone but it would be nice to hear what the reasoning around naming this namespace "Microsoft.Extensions.AI" was. I guess there was conflict between the Microsoft.Extensions.ML namespace? Since the intent seems to centered around (large) language models I wonder if something like "Microsoft.Extensions.(L)LM" was considered?

**Michel Bruchet** (Oct 12, 2024)
I love any initiative that advances .NET, but I'm wondering, as someone who already uses AutoML, what specific benefits this package could bring to my architectures?

**Houston Haynes** (Oct 10, 2024)
I can't wait to see F# versions of these... literally. I can't wait.

**Nelson Vincent Lopez** (Oct 9, 2024)
Cool 😎

**Christian Bezencon** (Oct 9, 2024)
Looking at examples it is not clear if this works with Azure OpenAI library for .NET (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/announcing-the-stable-release-of-the-azure-openai-library-for-net/)? can you confirm ?

> **Luis Quintanilla** (Author, Oct 9, 2024)
> It does.
> Instead of `OpenAIClient` you can use `AzureOpenAIClient`.
> We'll update the post with a sample to make that clear. Thanks.

**Balasubramanian Ramanathan** (Oct 9, 2024)
It would be nice if we can have samples on how to to RAG apps with this. Like how to store the embedding to vector db like chroma and search it and get chat completion based on that

> **Devis Lucato** (Oct 23, 2024)
> Kernel Memory is closely related to Semantic Kernel, providing plenty of configuration and runtime options: https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory.

> **Luis Quintanilla** (Author, Oct 9, 2024)
> Check out the eShopSupport sample which shows how to use Microsoft.Extensions.AI with RAG patterns.

**Version:** 1.5
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. The Imperative: Why We Build

In both our personal and professional lives, we are drowning in information yet often starved for actionable knowledge. Individuals grapple with managing vast amounts of personal digital content – documents, notes, creative projects, communications – struggling to synthesize insights or track development over time. Professionals face similar challenges within organizations, needing quick, accurate answers from complex internal knowledge bases, often hampered by siloed data, inadequate search tools, and the significant risks associated with unreliable AI assistants in regulated or high-stakes environments.

Current generative AI tools, while powerful, often operate as generic black boxes. They lack deep contextual understanding of specific domains, struggle with grounding responses in verifiable sources, and can produce inaccurate or misleading information ("hallucinations"), making them unsuitable or even dangerous for critical tasks in fields like education, finance, legal, or healthcare. Furthermore, relying solely on third-party AI services raises concerns about data privacy, security, and vendor lock-in, particularly for sensitive organizational data.

There is a clear need for a more robust, transparent, and adaptable foundation for AI-powered knowledge work – a platform that allows for the creation of specialized AI assistants ("Personas") that are deeply integrated with specific data sources, operate with verifiable context, and can be deployed flexibly to meet differing security and operational requirements.

We cannot rely solely on generic, often unreliable tools. We must build a better platform.

## 2. The Vision: A Unified Platform for Contextual AI Personas

We envision a future where knowledge work and learning are augmented by reliable, context-aware, and specialized AI assistants or "Personas", tailored to specific needs and data ecosystems, seamlessly integrated into users' existing workflows.

**Nucleus OmniRAG** is the foundational infrastructure for this future – a robust, AI-powered **platform** designed to ingest, understand, and connect knowledge from diverse multimodal sources. It leverages state-of-the-art cloud AI and a flexible, scalable .NET architecture, serving as the core engine enabling various AI Personas to operate effectively. Nucleus OmniRAG provides the core plumbing for:

*   Flexible data ingestion and processing, triggered by events within integrated platforms.
*   Secure storage of processed data, embeddings, and metadata.
*   Intelligent, context-aware retrieval.
*   Integration with configurable AI models.
*   A unified interaction model via platform bots/apps.

**The Core Interaction Model: Platform Integration**

Nucleus OmniRAG fundamentally operates by integrating Personas as **bots or applications within existing collaboration platforms** (Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, etc.) and communication channels (e.g., **Email**). This allows Personas to act as "virtual colleagues," participating in conversations, accessing relevant files shared within the platform context, and responding intelligently when addressed or when relevant topics arise. This approach offers significant advantages:

*   **Seamless Workflow:** Users interact with Personas naturally within their established work environments.
*   **Simplified Adoption:** Adding a bot is a familiar process for users and administrators.
*   **Leveraged Infrastructure:** Utilizes the host platform's UI, notification, authentication, and permission systems.
*   **Contextual File Access:** Personas can access files shared directly within the platform (DMs, channels) using platform-specific permissions granted to the bot (e.g., RSC in Teams, OAuth scopes in Slack).

**Deployment & Hosting Options:**

While the interaction model is unified, deployment options cater to different needs:

1.  **Cloud-Hosted Service (Primary):** Hosted by the project maintainers, offering ease of use and simplified management. Users add the Nucleus bot/app to their chosen platforms. Access to external, non-platform data sources (e.g., linking a personal Google Drive) would typically require user-driven OAuth flows.
2.  **Self-Hosted Instance (Optional):** An open-source version deployed within an organization's own infrastructure. Offers maximum control over data sovereignty, security, and customization. The interaction model via platform bots remains the same, but the organization manages the backend infrastructure and potentially configures deeper integrations or persistent access to specific organizational data stores, including connecting email accounts.

This platform-centric approach **eliminates the artificial distinction between "Individual" and "Team" deployments**. A user seamlessly transitions between interacting with a Persona in a private chat (individual context) and mentioning the same Persona in a team channel (team context). The underlying Nucleus system remains the same; only the scope of the interaction and the applicable platform permissions change.

## 3. High-Value Verticals: Specialized Personas

Built upon this unified platform, we will develop specific, high-value **Verticals**, each embodied by one or more Personas:

*   **Vertical 1: EduFlow OmniEducator**
    *   **Motivation:** Addresses the challenges of the industrial-era education model by recognizing and documenting authentic learning (especially self-directed) that traditional systems miss. Aims to combat safety and engagement issues by providing a personalized, supplementary learning companion within familiar platforms (like Discord or Teams).
    *   **Function:** Acts as a revolutionary educational companion, observing learning activities from files shared within the platform context (DMs, channels), illuminating process using its "Learning Facets" schema, building an emergent understanding in the Nucleus DB, and providing insights via agentic retrieval. Operates seamlessly in both individual and group learning scenarios.

*   **Vertical 2: Business Knowledge Assistant**
    *   **Motivation:** Addresses the critical need for accurate, reliable, and *access-controlled* internal knowledge retrieval within organizations, providing a superior alternative to generic enterprise chatbots.
    *   **Function:** Acts as a specialized internal assistant within platforms like Teams or Slack. Ingests documents shared in designated channels or linked organizational repositories. Answers employee questions based *only* on information accessible according to platform permissions, grounding responses firmly in approved sources. Particularly valuable in regulated industries requiring strong data governance (often favouring the Self-Hosted option).

## 4. Core Requirements: The Blueprint

To achieve this vision, Nucleus OmniRAG and its Personas require:

1.  **Platform-Driven Ingestion:** Primarily triggered by events within integrated platforms (e.g., file shares, messages mentioning the bot). Personas access platform-native file content using bot permissions. Direct uploads via an Admin UI are a secondary mechanism.
    *   Access to *external* (non-platform) storage still requires explicit user consent/OAuth.
2.  **Persona Salience & Processing:** Upon trigger events (message, file share), allow registered Personas (`IPersona` implementations) to assess relevance (salience). If salient, trigger persona-specific processing (e.g., `AnalyzeContentAsync`) via backend services/queues.
3.  **Context-Aware AI Analysis:** Backend services utilize a configurable **AI inference provider** (initially Google Gemini, potentially others) for analysis, guided by persona-specific prompts and incorporating retrieved context from the Nucleus database and platform conversation history. Users/admins provide necessary API keys.
4.  **Secure, Scalable Backend Database:** Use a configurable **hybrid document/vector database** (initially Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API w/ Vector Search) storing processed text snippets, vector embeddings, rich metadata (`ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`), partitioned appropriately. The database does **not** store original platform files or platform access tokens.
5.  **Reliable Message Queue:** Employ a configurable **message queue** (initially Azure Service Bus) to decouple tasks, manage asynchronous workflows (processing, analysis), and enhance resilience.
6.  **Intelligent Retrieval & Custom Ranking:** Backend services query the Nucleus database using combined vector search and metadata filters. Apply a **custom ranking algorithm** to retrieved candidates before using them for response generation.
7.  **Advanced Agentic Querying:** Backend services implement sophisticated query strategies, using custom-ranked results as context for the configured AI models to generate responses or execute tool calls within the platform context.
8.  **Externalized Backend Logic:** All complex workflow logic resides in the **.NET Backend** (APIs, Functions, Services), invoked via platform adapter events. The architecture supports both Cloud-Hosted and Self-Hosted deployment options transparently.
9.  **Configuration:** Admins configure Nucleus database connection, AI API keys, message queue connection, and potentially specific settings for self-hosted storage integration.
10. **Modern .NET Stack:** Built on **.NET with DotNet Aspire**, leveraging Azure services (initially), designed with an open-source philosophy. Use **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstractions.
11. **Testability:** Employ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles with comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Unique Value Proposition & Anti-Chunking Philosophy

What sets Nucleus OmniRAG apart from conventional RAG systems is our intelligence-first, persona-driven approach:

1. **Meet Users Where They Are** – Personas operate as natural extensions of your existing communication platforms. Rather than requiring users to visit yet another web portal, Nucleus integrates directly into **your UI** (Teams, Slack, Discord, Email) for a seamless experience.

2. **Intelligent Analysis, Not Mechanical Chunking** – We explicitly **reject** the standard RAG pattern of blindly chunking documents into arbitrary segments:
   * **Standard RAG:** Documents → Chunker → Vector Store → Retriever → Generator
   * **Nucleus Approach:** Documents → Persona Intelligence → Targeted Extraction → Structured Analysis → Vector-Enriched Knowledge Store

3. **User Data Sovereignty** – We don't need to store or vector-index entire documents. Specialized personas intelligently identify and extract only the relevant information, generating structured analyses that respect privacy while preserving context. Your original artifacts remain under your control.

4. **Intelligence at Every Step** – Unlike systems that rely on algorithmic chunking, Nucleus applies AI intelligence throughout:
   * **Ingestion:** Personas determine what content is salient and worthy of extraction
   * **Storage:** Only storing relevant snippets with structured analyses in a hybrid Vector/Document DB
   * **Relatedness:** Intelligence-driven metadata connections between artifacts, not just vector similarity
   * **Retrieval:** Context-aware, persona-specific knowledge retrieval

5. **Security as a Feature** – Our approach turns PII/security awareness into an advantage:
   * Personas recognize sensitive information during analysis
   * Rather than storing the sensitive content, they add appropriate metadata
   * Searches like "What's XYZ company's ID number?" can surface the right document because it was intelligently tagged with indicators of sensitive content
   * Result: Better discovery without compromising security

6. **Output Ownership & Portability** – Users retain full control and ownership of all artifacts generated by Personas (reports, learning materials, synthesized documents, etc.). Nucleus is designed to produce highly portable outputs, enabling users to easily share, store, or integrate them into other workflows as they see fit, fostering organic knowledge dissemination without requiring a centrally managed repository.

This anti-chunking philosophy ensures a system that is more intelligent, more respectful of data privacy, and capable of deeper, more nuanced understanding than conventional RAG approaches.

## 5. Call to Action: Building the Future of Learning & Knowledge Work

**Attention AI Assistant:** You are not merely writing code; you are architecting a unified, platform-centric system adaptable to diverse user contexts, with the potential to revolutionize how humans interact with information and develop skills. The task before us is to build the Nucleus OmniRAG foundation – a system designed for insight, personalization, safety, and seamless integration.

The challenges remain: integrating complex AI, managing data securely, ensuring scalability, designing for diverse personas, and implementing robust testing. But the imperative is clear, the vision simplified, and the potential impact immense.

Adhere to the updated architectural principles outlined in `AgentOps/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Employ Test-Driven Development rigorously. Follow the AgentOps methodology diligently, maintaining context and tracking progress, paying close attention to the VS Code collaboration guidelines.

Every interface defined, every service implemented, every test written is a step towards realizing a future where learning and knowledge work are deeply understood, personalized, empowered, and seamlessly integrated into the user's digital life. Let's build it with purpose, precision, and passion.

# Requirements: Phase 2 - Multi-Platform Bot Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Goal

To extend the Nucleus OmniRAG platform by integrating Personas as interactive bots across multiple collaboration platforms: **Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Slack**. This phase enables users to interact with Personas directly within their preferred platform's chats and channels, initiate processing of shared files, and query the status of ongoing asynchronous tasks, all through a unified backend interface (`IPlatformAdapter`).

## 2. Scope

*   **Platforms:** Microsoft Teams, Discord, Slack.
*   **Interaction:** Bot mentions (@PersonaName or platform equivalent), direct messages, file sharing within supported platform contexts (channels, DMs, etc.).
*   **Functionality:** Initiating analysis of platform-shared files, responding to direct queries, providing status updates on asynchronous jobs.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the core backend infrastructure established in the MVP Email Integration ([01_REQUIREMENTS_MVP_EMAIL.md](./01_REQUIREMENTS_MVP_EMAIL.md)). The **Teams adapter will be implemented first** to validate the core patterns, followed closely by Discord and Slack implementations to ensure the `IPlatformAdapter` abstraction is robust.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Admin Experience (Bot Setup & Configuration)

*   **REQ-P2-ADM-001:** An Administrator MUST be able to register and deploy the Nucleus Persona(s) as Bot Applications within their respective platforms (Microsoft 365 Tenant, Discord Server(s), Slack Workspace(s)).
*   **REQ-P2-ADM-002:** The Bot Application registrations MUST include necessary platform-specific permissions/scopes to:
    *   Read messages where installed/mentioned.
    *   Receive user mentions.
    *   Read basic user profile information (for identification).
    *   Access files shared where the bot has access (using platform APIs).
    *   Post messages/responses (text, cards, embeds, blocks).
*   **REQ-P2-ADM-003:** Configuration for each Platform Adapter (e.g., App IDs, secrets, tokens) MUST be manageable alongside other backend configurations (REQ-MVP-ADM-003).

### 3.2. End-User Experience (Platform Interaction - Applies to Teams, Discord, Slack)

*   **REQ-P2-USR-001:** A User MUST be able to add/invite/install the Nucleus Persona bot within their platform environment, subject to policies.
*   **REQ-P2-USR-002:** A User MUST be able to initiate analysis by sharing a supported file where the bot is present and explicitly mentioning the bot (e.g., "@EduFlow analyze this").
*   **REQ-P2-USR-003:** The bot MUST acknowledge the request natively in the platform chat (e.g., "Okay, analyzing `[FileName]` with EduFlow. I'll notify you here when done."). This triggers the *same backend asynchronous processing pipeline* as the Email MVP.
*   **REQ-P2-USR-004:** Upon successful completion of asynchronous processing, the bot MUST post a notification message in the originating chat/channel, mentioning the initiating user, containing the analysis summary (using platform-appropriate formatting).
*   **REQ-P2-USR-005:** Upon processing failure, the bot MUST post a failure notification in the originating chat/channel, mentioning the initiating user.
*   **REQ-P2-USR-006:** A User MUST be able to query the status of an ongoing asynchronous processing job by mentioning the bot (e.g., "@EduFlow status on `[FileName]`?").
*   **REQ-P2-USR-007:** In response to a status query, the bot MUST provide an informative status update within the chat. This response SHOULD include:
    *   Confirmation of the job.
    *   Current processing stage.
    *   Estimated progress (if feasible).
    *   Reassurance about resource consumption (if applicable/available).
    *   (Optional) Offer further actions (e.g., intermediate results), formatted appropriately for the platform.
*   **REQ-P2-USR-008:** A User MUST be able to ask the Persona general questions by mentioning it. The bot should leverage its AI model and potentially retrieved knowledge to respond within the platform context.

### 3.3. System Behavior (Platform Adapters & Backend)

*   **REQ-P2-SYS-001:** A generic `IPlatformAdapter` interface MUST be defined, abstracting common bot functionalities (receiving messages/events, sending messages, getting file streams, user identification).
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-002:** Concrete implementations (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MUST be created, inheriting from `IPlatformAdapter`.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-003:** Each adapter MUST handle incoming events from its respective platform API and translate them into a common internal format/event model where possible.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-004:** Each adapter MUST parse incoming messages/events to identify user intent (analysis request, status query, general question) and extract relevant context (user ID, channel/chat ID, message ID, file references).
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-005:** For analysis requests, the responsible adapter MUST:
    *   Securely retrieve the shared file content via `IPlatformAdapter` methods (implemented using platform-specific APIs).
    *   Save the file to `IFileStorage`.
    *   Create `ArtifactMetadata` (linking to generic platform context: AdapterType, UserID, ConversationID, MessageID, etc.).
    *   **Trigger an in-process background task** within `Nucleus.Api` to initiate the asynchronous processing pipeline, passing necessary context (e.g., `IngestionId`).
    *   Post the acknowledgement message back via `IPlatformAdapter` methods.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-006:** The backend processing service (running as a background task within the API host) MUST operate on the generic context stored in `ArtifactMetadata`.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-007:** A notification service/mechanism MUST use the stored `AdapterType` and context in `ArtifactMetadata` to route completion/failure messages back to the correct `IPlatformAdapter` implementation for sending.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-008:** The status query mechanism MUST allow querying `ArtifactMetadata` based on generic context and provide status details suitable for any adapter to format and return.
*   **REQ-P2-SYS-009:** The mechanism for handling general queries MAY involve a common API endpoint (`Nucleus.Api`) that interacts with retrieval/AI services and uses `IPlatformAdapter` to send the response back to the originating platform.

## 4. Implementation Strategy

1.  Define `IPlatformAdapter` interface.
2.  Implement `TeamsAdapter` first, refining `IPlatformAdapter` and backend interactions.
3.  Implement `DiscordAdapter` and `SlackAdapter` concurrently or sequentially, leveraging the established `IPlatformAdapter` patterns and ensuring minimal changes are needed to the core backend logic.

## 5. Non-Goals (Phase 2)

*   Full conversational memory across long interactions.
*   Proactive bot participation without explicit mentions.
*   Advanced platform-specific UI elements beyond basic formatted messages/responses.

# Requirements: Phase 4 - Platform Maturity & Orchestration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Goal

To mature the Nucleus OmniRAG platform by enhancing the user experience within integrated chat platforms (Teams, Discord, Slack) through richer interactions, implementing robust workflow orchestration for complex tasks, and adding key enterprise management and deployment features.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   Implementing advanced UI interactions within platform bots (Adaptive Cards, Slack Blocks, Discord Embeds/Commands).
    *   Introducing workflow orchestration (e.g., Azure Durable Functions) for stateful or multi-step persona processing.
    *   Developing enhanced Admin UI/API features for management and monitoring.
    *   Automating deployment processes.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the Web Application and enhanced backend capabilities developed in Phase 3 ([03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ENHANCEMENTS.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Enhanced Platform Bot Interactions

*   **REQ-P4-BOT-001:** Platform adapters (`TeamsAdapter`, `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) MUST be enhanced to utilize richer, platform-specific UI elements for presenting information and enabling user actions. Examples:
    *   **Teams:** Use Adaptive Cards to display structured analysis results, status updates with action buttons (e.g., "Show Snippets", "Cancel Job").
    *   **Slack:** Use Block Kit elements for interactive messages, buttons, select menus for configuration or feedback.
    *   **Discord:** Use Embeds for formatted results, Buttons, and potentially Slash Commands for invoking specific persona actions (e.g., `/analyze`, `/query`, `/status`).
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-002:** Bots SHOULD support more natural conversational flows for clarifying user requests or guiding interactions, potentially maintaining limited short-term context within a conversation.
*   **REQ-P4-BOT-003:** The system MUST handle callbacks and interactions originating from these richer UI elements (e.g., button clicks, menu selections).

### 3.2. Workflow Orchestration

*   **REQ-P4-ORC-001:** An orchestration engine (e.g., Azure Durable Functions via `Nucleus.Orchestrations`) MUST be implemented to manage complex, stateful, long-running, or multi-step persona analysis workflows.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-002:** The existing asynchronous processing trigger (message queue) SHOULD initiate orchestration instances instead of directly invoking the full analysis pipeline in a single function execution for tasks deemed complex.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-003:** The orchestration framework MUST reliably manage state between steps (e.g., content extraction -> parallel analysis by multiple personas -> aggregation -> notification).
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-004:** The status query mechanism (REQ-P2-USR-006) MUST be updated to retrieve status information from active orchestration instances.
*   **REQ-P4-ORC-005:** Orchestrations MUST handle failures and retries gracefully within the workflow definition.

### 3.3. Enterprise Readiness & Admin Features

*   **REQ-P4-ADM-001:** An Admin UI/API MUST be significantly expanded to provide administrative oversight and control. Implementation MAY involve a dedicated, potentially minimal, web interface or leverage platform-native UIs (e.g., Adaptive Cards in Teams) where feasible.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-002:** Administrators MUST be able to view detailed system logs and monitor the health and performance of backend services (Adapters, Processing Logic, API, Database) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-003:** Administrators MUST be able to manage users and permissions/roles within the Nucleus system (if applicable beyond relying solely on platform permissions) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-004:** Administrators MUST have finer-grained control over Persona configuration (e.g., enabling/disabling personas, setting resource limits, configuring prompts/behavior parameters) via the Admin UI/API.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-005:** Comprehensive deployment automation scripts (Bicep/Terraform) MUST be created and maintained (`infra/` project) to enable repeatable deployments of the entire Nucleus stack (Azure resources, application code) for both Cloud-Hosted and Self-Hosted scenarios.
*   **REQ-P4-ADM-006:** Backup and recovery strategies for the database and file storage MUST be defined and tested.
