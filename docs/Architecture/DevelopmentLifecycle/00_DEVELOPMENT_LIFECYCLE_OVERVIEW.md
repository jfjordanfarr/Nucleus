# Development Lifecycle Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the development lifecycle adopted for the Nucleus project. Our approach is designed to foster robust, maintainable, and high-quality software, aligning with modern best practices for building distributed, AI-first systems. It outlines the key areas that define how we organize, build, test, and release Nucleus components, including M365 Persona Agents and backend MCP Tool/Server applications.

The goal is to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency for all contributors, including human developers and AI assistants collaborating on the project.

## 2. Core Principles of the Nucleus Development Lifecycle

Our development lifecycle is guided by several core principles:

*   **Documentation as Source Code:** Architectural and requirements documentation are treated with the rigor of source code, forming the primary specification from which implementations flow.
*   **Quality First:** Prioritizing well-designed, testable, and maintainable code and documentation over sheer speed of delivery.
*   **Modularity and Decoupling:** Building components (M365 Agents, MCP Tools, libraries) with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies.
*   **Automation:** Leveraging CI/CD pipelines for consistent builds, testing, and release processes.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Employing TDD where practical to drive design and ensure correctness.
*   **Consistency:** Adhering to defined standards for code style, naming conventions, and documentation.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrating security considerations throughout the development lifecycle.

## 3. Key Aspects of the Development Lifecycle

The Nucleus development lifecycle encompasses several key areas, each detailed in its respective document:

1.  **Code Organization: Namespaces and Folders**
    *   **Goal:** To establish a clear, logical, and consistent structure for the codebase, facilitating navigation, understanding, and maintainability.
    *   **Details:** See [./01_NAMESPACES_FOLDERS.md](./01_NAMESPACES_FOLDERS.md)

2.  **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
    *   **Goal:** To ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of all Nucleus components through a multi-layered testing approach.
    *   **Details:** See [./02_TESTING_STRATEGY.md](./02_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

3.  **Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Strategy**
    *   **Goal:** To automate the build, test, and release processes, ensuring rapid feedback, consistent artifact generation, and streamlined delivery of Nucleus components.
    *   **Details:** See [./03_CICD_STRATEGY.md](./03_CICD_STRATEGY.md)

4.  **Coding Standards & Style (Placeholder - Future Document)**
    *   **Goal:** To define consistent coding conventions, formatting guidelines, and best practices for C# development within Nucleus, enhancing readability and collaboration.
    *   *Details: To be elaborated in a dedicated document.*

5.  **Branching & Release Strategy (Placeholder - Future Document)**
    *   **Goal:** To outline the Git branching model, versioning strategy (SemVer), and release management process for the Nucleus project.
    *   *Details: To be elaborated in a dedicated document (currently, some aspects are in the CI/CD strategy).*

6.  **Documentation Standards (Placeholder - Future Document)**
    *   **Goal:** To establish guidelines for creating and maintaining high-quality, consistent, and discoverable project documentation.
    *   *Details: To be elaborated in a dedicated document.*

7.  **Security in the Development Lifecycle (Placeholder - Future Document)**
    *   **Goal:** To integrate security best practices throughout all phases of development, from design and coding to testing and deployment.
    *   *Details: To be elaborated in a dedicated document, complementing the overall [Security Overview and Governance](../../Security/01_SECURITY_OVERVIEW_AND_GOVERNANCE.md).*

This overview serves as an entry point to the detailed standards and processes that guide Nucleus development. Adherence to these practices is crucial for the long-term success and health of the project.
