# Project: Nucleus.Adapters.Console

**Relative Path:** `src/Nucleus.Adapters/Nucleus.Adapters.Console/Nucleus.Adapters.Console.csproj`

## 1. Purpose

This project implements a command-line interface (CLI) that serves as an adapter for interacting with the Nucleus system. It is primarily intended for development, local testing, demonstrations, and administrative tasks.

The Console Adapter allows users to issue commands that can trigger various functionalities within Nucleus, such as initiating content processing, querying the knowledge store, or managing persona configurations. It achieves this by interacting with core Nucleus services, typically by invoking functionalities within `Nucleus.Core.AgentRuntime` or by making requests to a locally running Nucleus instance (potentially via Model Context Protocol (MCP) in more advanced scenarios, or through direct service calls for simpler local interactions).

## 2. Key Components

*   **`Program.cs`**: The main entry point for the CLI application, responsible for setting up the host, dependency injection, and command parsing.
*   **Command-Line Argument Parsing Logic:** Utilizes libraries like `System.CommandLine` to define and parse CLI commands, options, and arguments.
*   **Interaction Logic / Command Handlers:** Classes or methods responsible for translating parsed CLI commands into specific actions or instructions for the Nucleus system (e.g., constructing `AgentInstruction` objects or parameters for service calls).
*   **Service Invocation Logic:** Code that interacts with `Nucleus.Core.AgentRuntime` services or other relevant core components to execute the requested operations.
*   **Output Formatting Logic:** Components responsible for presenting results, status messages, and errors to the console in a user-friendly format.

## 3. Dependencies

*   `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions` (Provides access to shared DTOs, interfaces, and enums).
*   `Nucleus.Core.AgentRuntime` (For invoking core agentic functionalities and business logic).
*   `System.CommandLine` (For robust command-line argument parsing and command definition).
*   `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` (For application lifetime management, configuration, and dependency injection).
*   `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` (For setting up DI services).
*   `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` (For console logging).

## 4. Dependents

*   `Nucleus.AppHost` (May reference this project to include the console application in the Aspire application model, allowing it to be launched and managed during development and testing).
*   As an executable, it is not typically a library dependency for other runtime projects but serves as a standalone tool.
