# Project: Nucleus.Infrastructure.Messaging

**Relative Path:** `src/Nucleus.Infrastructure/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Messaging/Nucleus.Infrastructure.Messaging.csproj`

## 1. Purpose

This project provides the infrastructure components related to message queuing and asynchronous task processing within the Nucleus ecosystem. It is designed to host concrete implementations of messaging abstractions defined in `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions.Messaging`.

Initially, this project will house an `InMemoryBackgroundTaskQueue` which is crucial for local development, testing, and scenarios where an external message broker is not required or available. This in-memory queue facilitates asynchronous processing of tasks, such as those derived from `NucleusIngestionRequest` objects.

In the future, this project can be expanded to include client implementations or wrappers for various external message brokers (e.g., Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ). This architectural approach ensures that the core application logic remains decoupled from specific messaging technologies, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in different deployment environments.

## 2. Key Components

*   **`InMemoryBackgroundTaskQueue.cs`**: An in-memory implementation of the `IBackgroundTaskQueue` interface (defined in `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions.Messaging`). This component is responsible for queuing work items (e.g., `Func<CancellationToken, Task>`) for background processing.
*   **Service Collection Extensions (e.g., `AddInMemoryMessagingServices`):** Methods to simplify the registration of messaging services with the dependency injection container.
*   **(Future) Broker-Specific Implementations:** Placeholder for future classes that will implement `IBackgroundTaskQueue` or other relevant messaging interfaces for specific message brokers (e.g., `AzureServiceBusQueue`). These would encapsulate broker-specific client logic and configuration.

## 3. Dependencies

*   `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions` (Provides interfaces like `IBackgroundTaskQueue` and potentially shared message contracts or DTOs).
*   `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` (For structured logging within queue implementations).
*   `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` (Potentially for background service hosting patterns).
*   `(Future) SDKs for specific message brokers` (e.g., `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus`).

## 4. Dependents

*   `Nucleus.Core.AgentRuntime` (Likely to register and inject `IBackgroundTaskQueue` implementations for orchestrating asynchronous agent tasks).
*   `Nucleus.AppHost` (References this project for dependency injection setup and to include it in the application composition).
*   Other services or components within the Nucleus ecosystem that require asynchronous task execution.
