# Project: Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic

**Relative Path:** `src/Nucleus.Domain/Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic/Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic.csproj` (Example, confirm actual path)

## 1. Purpose

This project, `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic`, encapsulates the core domain logic specifically related to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Content Processing and Analysis:** Logic for breaking down, understanding, and structuring raw content from various sources.
*   **Knowledge Extraction:** Identifying and extracting salient information, entities, and relationships from processed content.
*   **Embedding Generation Strategy:** Defining how and when embeddings should be generated for content snippets (though the actual embedding generation might be offloaded to an infrastructure component).
*   **Intelligent Retrieval Strategies:** Logic for formulating queries, retrieving relevant context from knowledge stores (vector and metadata-based), and ranking results.
*   **Prompt Augmentation:** Techniques for constructing effective prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the retrieved and ranked context.
*   **PersonaKnowledgeEntry Creation:** Defining the business rules and transformations for creating and structuring `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` items based on analyzed content.

This layer is responsible for the "intelligence" in transforming raw content into structured, retrievable knowledge and leveraging that knowledge for AI-driven insights and responses. It is distinct from the direct orchestration of user-facing interactions (handled by Agents) or the specifics of LLM communication (handled by MCP Tools or Infrastructure layers).

## 2. Key Components

*   **Services for Content Analysis:**
    *   `ContentSegmentationService`: Logic for intelligently dividing content into meaningful chunks.
    *   `EntityExtractionService`: Services to identify and extract named entities or custom-defined entities.
    *   `SummarizationService`: Logic to generate summaries or key points from content.
*   **Services for RAG Pipeline:**
    *   `RetrievalStrategyService`: Implements different strategies for retrieving relevant context (e.g., vector search, hybrid search, graph traversal).
    *   `ContextRankingService`: Ranks retrieved context based on relevance, recency, or other custom criteria.
    *   `PromptConstructionService`: Builds optimized prompts for LLMs, incorporating retrieved context.
*   **Domain Models & Value Objects (specific to RAG logic):**
    *   `ProcessedContentSnippet`: Represents a segment of content after initial processing and analysis.
    *   `RetrievalCandidate`: An item retrieved from a knowledge store, before final ranking.
    *   `AugmentedContext`: The curated set of context items to be included in a prompt.
*   **Interfaces for Extensibility:**
    *   `IContentProcessor`: Interface for different types of content processors.
    *   `IRetrievalStrategy`: Interface for different retrieval algorithms.

## 3. Dependencies

*   **`Nucleus.Shared.Kernel`**: For core abstractions like `ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`, `IPersona`, and shared utility types.
*   Potentially interfaces from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` if this layer directly orchestrates calls to AI services for analysis tasks (though often this is delegated to an `Nucleus.Infrastructure.Ai.<Provider>` via an interface defined here or in Kernel).

## 4. Dependents

*   **`Nucleus.McpTool.ContentProcessing`**: This MCP Tool would heavily utilize services from `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` to perform its content analysis and structuring tasks.
*   **`Nucleus.McpTool.RAGPipeline`**: This MCP Tool would orchestrate the RAG flow, relying on services within `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` for retrieval, ranking, and prompt augmentation.
*   Potentially other MCP Tools or even Agent applications if they require direct access to sophisticated RAG processing capabilities not exposed via higher-level MCP Tools.
