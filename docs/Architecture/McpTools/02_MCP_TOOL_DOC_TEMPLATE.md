# MCP Tool: <Tool Name> Architecture

## 1. Purpose and Core Responsibilities

*   Clearly define the **primary goal** of this MCP Tool within the Nucleus ecosystem.
*   What specific set of backend Nucleus capabilities does it encapsulate and expose?
*   How does it contribute to the overall functionality of Nucleus M365 Persona Agents?

## 2. Key MCP Operations / Tools Exposed

*   List and describe each **MCP Tool operation** this server will expose. For each operation:
    *   **`OperationName`** (e.g., `KnowledgeStore.SearchArtifactMetadata`, `FileAccess.GetEphemeralContentStream`)
    *   **Description:** What the operation does, when an M365 Agent should call it.
    *   **Input Parameters (Conceptual DTOs):** What data does it expect (e.g., `ArtifactReference`, `TenantId`, `QueryParameters`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntryData`). Refer to DTOs defined in `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions.Models` (or similar path for core shared DTOs) or define new DTOs if specific to this tool's contract and clearly note their intended project location.
    *   **Output/Return Value (Conceptual DTOs):** What data does it return (e.g., `ListOfArtifactMetadata`, `EphemeralContentStreamResult`, `PersistenceConfirmation`). Refer to or define DTOs as per input parameters.
    *   **Idempotency considerations** (if applicable).
    *   **Error Handling:** How are common errors represented in the MCP response?

## 3. Core Internal Logic & Components

*   Describe the main internal components and logic flow within this MCP Tool.
*   What key Nucleus interfaces (e.g., from `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions`) does it implement or utilize (e.g., `IArtifactProvider` for `Nucleus_FileAccess_McpServer`, `IArtifactMetadataRepository` for `Nucleus_KnowledgeStore_McpServer`)?
*   What Nucleus domain libraries (e.g., `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` for `Nucleus_RAGPipeline_McpServer`) does it use?
*   How does it handle `tenantId` scoping internally for all its operations?

## 4. Dependencies

*   **Azure Services:** (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB for `KnowledgeStoreMCP`, Azure Key Vault for secrets, Azure App Configuration for static settings).
*   **External Services/LLMs:** (e.g., `ContentProcessingMCP` might call a configured LLM for summarization or image description if not done by the agent).
*   **Other Nucleus MCP Tools:** (e.g., `RAGPipelineMCP` will definitely call `KnowledgeStoreMCP`).
*   **Shared Nucleus Libraries:** (`Nucleus.Shared.Kernel.Abstractions`, `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` (if applicable), `Nucleus.Infrastructure.*` for specific implementations like `CosmosDb` or `FileProviders`).

## 5. Security Model

*   **Authentication of Callers:** How does this MCP Tool authenticate incoming requests from Nucleus M365 Persona Agents (or other authorized clients)? (e.g., Validating Azure AD tokens, checking for specific scopes/roles).
*   **Authorization within the Tool:** Once authenticated, how does it authorize specific operations? (e.g., based on claims in the token, like `tenantId` or specific app roles granted to the calling agent).
*   **Authentication to Dependencies:** How does this MCP Tool securely authenticate to its own dependencies (e.g., using its Managed Identity for Cosmos DB, Key Vault)?

## 6. Data Handling & Persistence (If Applicable)

*   If this tool interacts with persistent data (e.g., `KnowledgeStoreMCP`), reiterate how tenant isolation is achieved.
*   Describe any specific data schemas or indexing strategies relevant to this tool's function within Cosmos DB (complementing the overall strategy in `Docs/Architecture/CoreNucleus/03_DATA_PERSISTENCE_STRATEGY.md`). Ensure `tenantId` usage for data isolation is explicitly covered.

## 7. Deployment & Configuration Considerations

*   Briefly mention typical deployment (e.g., Azure Container App).
*   Key configuration settings this tool requires (e.g., DB connection string, LLM API key name from Key Vault).

## 8. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

*   (Optional) Any planned future capabilities for this specific tool.
