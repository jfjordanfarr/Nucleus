# Age 8 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 8**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

At age 8 (typically 2nd or 3rd Grade), children become more fluent readers and writers, tackle multi-step problems, begin to understand more abstract concepts, and develop more complex social interactions.

## Pedagogical Tree: Age 8 (End-of-Year Capabilities)

Focuses on the *domains* of knowledge and skill typically mastered or significantly developed during the eighth year.
