# Age 7 Knowledge Trees

This document outlines the specific **Pedagogical** and **Tautological** knowledge trees for capabilities typically expected by the end of **Age 7**. It forms part of the framework described in the main [Educator Persona Knowledge Trees](../ARCHITECTURE_EDUCATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TREES.md) document.

At age 7 (typically 1st or 2nd Grade), children demonstrate more independence in reading and writing, begin exploring more complex mathematical concepts, and develop a stronger sense of community and rules.

## Pedagogical Tree: Age 7 (End-of-Year Capabilities)

Focuses on the *domains* of knowledge and skill typically mastered or significantly developed during the seventh year.
