# Architecture: Data Visualization Strategy

This document outlines the architectural approach for generating data visualizations within the Nucleus platform. The primary goal is to ensure a loosely coupled, flexible, and maintainable system.

## Core Principle: API-Centric Data Provisioning

Data visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs, dashboards) presented to the user should, wherever feasible, be driven by data retrieved from `Nucleus.Services.Api` endpoints rather than direct C# object manipulation within the presentation or HTML generation layer.

**Key Characteristics:**

1.  **Standardized Data Formats:** The API will expose data intended for visualization in standard, web-friendly formats, primarily JSON. This allows visualization components (whether server-rendered or client-rendered) to consume data in a consistent manner.
2.  **Decoupling Presentation from Core Logic:** The components responsible for rendering visualizations (e.g., a dedicated microservice, a client-side JavaScript library, or server-side HTML templating engines) will consume data from the API. This decouples the visualization technology and rendering logic from the core business logic and data retrieval mechanisms within Nucleus services.
3.  **API as the Source of Truth:** The `Nucleus.Services.Api` acts as the definitive source for data. Visualization components request the specific data they need (e.g., aggregated statistics, time-series data) via dedicated API endpoints.
4.  **Flexibility in Visualization Tooling:** By relying on API-delivered data, Nucleus gains the flexibility to adopt various visualization libraries or tools (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, server-side charting components) without tightly coupling them to internal data structures.
5.  **Simplified Maintenance:** Changes to internal data models or business logic are less likely to directly break visualization rendering, provided the API contract for visualization data remains stable.

## Interaction Pattern

1.  **User Request:** A user interacts with a client application (e.g., Web UI, Teams Adapter) that requires a data visualization.
2.  **API Call for Visualization Data:** The client application (or a backend-for-frontend service) makes a request to a specific endpoint on `Nucleus.Services.Api` designed to provide data suitable for the required visualization.
    *   Example Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/analytics/user-activity-summary?timespan=7d`
3.  **API Processes and Returns Data:** `Nucleus.Services.Api` gathers, aggregates, and transforms the necessary data from underlying services and data stores, returning it as a JSON payload.
    *   Example JSON Response:
        ```json
        {
          "reportTitle": "User Activity Summary (Last 7 Days)",
          "chartType": "bar",
          "labels": ["Day 1", "Day 2", "Day 3", "Day 4", "Day 5", "Day 6", "Day 7"],
          "datasets": [{
            "label": "Interactions",
            "data": [120, 150, 180, 130, 160, 190, 170],
            "backgroundColor": "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)"
          }]
        }
        ```
4.  **Visualization Rendering:** The client application or presentation layer receives the JSON data and uses an appropriate charting library or templating mechanism to render the HTML visualization.
    *   If server-side rendering is used, a templating engine might take this JSON and generate the necessary HTML and JavaScript.
    *   If client-side rendering is used (e.g., in a SPA), JavaScript libraries will directly consume the JSON to draw the chart in the browser.

## Exceptions and Considerations

*   **Highly Dynamic/Real-time Visualizations:** For visualizations requiring very high frequency updates or direct interaction with real-time data streams not easily served via conventional request-response API calls, alternative patterns (e.g., WebSockets pushing data updates) might be considered. However, the initial data load and configuration should still ideally be sourced via API.
*   **Embedded Static Reports:** For simple, static reports generated as part of a document (e.g., a PDF output), the generation logic might be more tightly coupled if an API roundtrip introduces unnecessary complexity. However, the underlying data for such reports should still originate from well-defined service layer methods.

By adhering to this API-centric approach, Nucleus aims to build a robust and adaptable system for data visualization.
