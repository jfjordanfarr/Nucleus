title: "DEPRECATED - API Architecture"
description: "This document is archived. The Nucleus API has been superseded by the M365 Agents SDK and Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture."

**THIS DOCUMENT IS ARCHIVED AND SUPERSEDED.**

The monolithic API described herein (`Nucleus.Services.Api`) is no longer the primary interaction point for Nucleus.

The project has pivoted to a distributed architecture based on:

1.  **Microsoft 365 Persona Agents:** These are applications built using the M365 Agents SDK that embody specific Personas. They handle user interactions within platforms like Microsoft Teams and orchestrate backend operations.
2.  **Nucleus MCP Tools/Servers:** These are backend services (e.g., `Nucleus_FileAccess_McpServer`, `Nucleus_ContentProcessing_McpServer`, `Nucleus_KnowledgeStore_McpServer`) that expose functionality via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). M365 Persona Agents call these tools to perform specific tasks like file access, content processing, and knowledge retrieval.

Please refer to the following documents for the current architecture:

*   `Docs/Architecture/00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
*   `Docs/Architecture/02_ARCHITECTURE_PERSONAS.md`
*   `Docs/Architecture/05_ARCHITECTURE_CLIENTS.md` (now focused on M365 Agents)
*   `Docs/Architecture/07_ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
*   `Docs/Architecture/12_ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACTIONS.md` (details on MCP and M365 Agent SDK integration)

All new development should align with this M365 Agents SDK and MCP-based approach.
