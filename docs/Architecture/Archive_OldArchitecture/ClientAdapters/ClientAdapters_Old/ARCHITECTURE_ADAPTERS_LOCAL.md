# Client Adapter: Local (For MCP Tool/Library Testing)

## 1. Revised Purpose in M365 Agent & MCP Architecture

With the strategic pivot to the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the `LocalAdapter` no longer serves as a direct user-facing client. Instead, its primary role has evolved to become a **crucial testing utility** for:

1.  **Backend MCP Tool Applications:** Simulating invocations and data exchanges with Nucleus services that are designed to function as MCP Tools.
2.  **Backend MCP Server Applications:** Testing the server-side components that would host and manage MCP Tools.
3.  **Shared Core Libraries:** Exercising shared logic (e.g., processing, analysis, data access) independently of a full M365 Agent deployment.

It allows developers to directly invoke and test the functionality of these backend components by mimicking the types of requests and context an M365 Agent would provide via MCP.

## 2. Key Functions in a Testing Context

*   **MCP Request Simulation:** The `LocalAdapter` can be used to construct and send MCP-compliant requests to a locally running Nucleus MCP Tool or Server instance.
*   **Contextual Data Mocking:** Facilitates the provision of mock `ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` objects, and other contextual information that an MCP Tool would expect.
*   **Direct Invocation:** Enables direct method calls to Nucleus services or MCP Tool handlers, bypassing the need for a full M365 Agent frontend.
*   **Simplified Interaction Loop:** Provides a streamlined way to send input (e.g., text prompts, file paths for local test data) and receive output from backend services.
*   **Configuration Flexibility:** Can be configured to point to different local or development endpoints for Nucleus services.

## 3. Simulated Interaction Flow (Testing MCP Tools)

1.  **Test Setup:** A test harness (e.g., a unit test, integration test, or a simple console application using the `LocalAdapter`) prepares a request.
    *   This includes defining the target MCP Tool/endpoint.
    *   Mocking necessary input data, such as simulated user queries, references to local file paths (for testing content processing), or pre-defined `ArtifactMetadata`.
2.  **Request Invocation:** The `LocalAdapter` (or test harness using its components) sends the simulated MCP request to the Nucleus backend service/MCP Tool.
3.  **Backend Processing:** The Nucleus service/MCP Tool processes the request as it normally would, potentially interacting with the database, AI models (which might also be mocked or configured for test environments), and other internal components.
4.  **Response Generation:** The service/MCP Tool generates an MCP-compliant response.
5.  **Response Reception & Assertion:** The `LocalAdapter` (or test harness) receives the response, allowing for assertions against the expected output, state changes, or side effects.

## 4. Artifact Handling for Testing

When testing content processing capabilities of MCP Tools:

*   The `LocalAdapter` will typically work with **local file system paths** provided during test setup.
*   It simulates the scenario where an M365 Agent has already retrieved a file and is now passing its content or a reference to the MCP Tool for analysis.
*   The backend MCP Tool, when invoked via this testing mechanism, would read from these local paths, mimicking how it might receive content in a real M365 Agent scenario (though the transport mechanism would differ).

## 5. Simulating Context

The `LocalAdapter` is instrumental in simulating the rich context that an M365 Agent would typically provide. This includes:

*   **Conversation History:** Mocking or constructing a simplified conversation history.
*   **User Identity:** Providing a test user identity.
*   **Platform Context:** Simulating relevant platform details if necessary for the MCP Tool's logic, though the focus is generally on the MCP interaction itself.

## 6. Use Cases

*   **Unit Testing:** Isolating and testing individual MCP Tools or Nucleus services.
*   **Integration Testing:** Verifying the interaction between different backend components in an MCP workflow.
*   **Development & Debugging:** Providing a quick way to iterate on backend logic without needing to deploy or interact through a full M365 Agent.

## 7. Limitations

*   **Not a User Interface:** It does not provide any graphical user interface.
*   **No Real Platform Integration:** It does not connect to actual external platforms like Teams, Slack, etc. Its purpose is to simulate the *data and control flow* that would come *from* such a platform via an M365 Agent.
*   **Focus on Backend:** Primarily designed for testing the Nucleus backend services and MCP Tools, not for simulating the M365 Agent's own internal logic or UI.

By repurposing the `LocalAdapter` in this manner, we maintain a valuable tool for robust backend development and testing within the new M365 Agent and MCP architectural paradigm.
