# Nucleus: System Architecture Overview (Executive Summary)

:title: Core Architectural Model
:type: vision_statement
:implements: platform_architecture

Nucleus is a platform for specialized AI assistants, embodied as **Nucleus M365 Persona Agent applications** built with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK. These agents interact with users on Microsoft 365 platforms and leverage backend **Nucleus MCP Tool/Server applications** for core functionalities like data persistence, ephemeral file access, and advanced RAG.

This architecture prioritizes:
- **M365 Integration:** Seamless user experience within existing workflows.
- **Distributed Capabilities:** Modular M365 Agents and backend MCP Tools for clear separation of concerns and scalability.
- **Zero Trust for User File Content:** Nucleus backend services never store raw user files; access is ephemeral and permission-bound.
- **AI Provider Flexibility:** Configurable support for Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter.AI, etc.
```

The Nucleus architecture is built upon several key pillars, each detailed in dedicated documentation:

- **Foundational Technologies:** Understanding the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and the **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK** is crucial.
  - *For details, see: [Foundations Technology Primer](./FoundationsTechnologyPrimer.MDMD.md)*
- **M365 Persona Agents:** These applications are the primary interface for user interaction and orchestrate backend capabilities.
  - *For an overview, see: [M365 Agents Overview](../../Specification/Concepts/M365AgentsOverview.MDMD.md)*
- **Backend MCP Tool/Servers:** These services provide the core data access, processing, and RAG logic for Nucleus.
  - *For an overview, see: [MCP Tools Overview](../../Specification/Concepts/McpToolsOverview.MDMD.md)*
- **Core Nucleus Concepts:** This includes persona definition, data persistence strategies, ephemeral processing pipelines, AI integration, and shared abstractions.
  - *Primary reference: Documents within [Requirements](../Requirements/)*
- **Deployment, Development Lifecycle, and Security:** Strategies for deploying, testing, and securing the distributed Nucleus system.
  - *Primary references: Documents within [Specification strata](../../Specification/)*
