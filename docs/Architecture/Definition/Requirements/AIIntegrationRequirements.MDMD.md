# Nucleus AI Integration Strategy

````{composition}
:title: AI Integration Requirements
:stratum: Definition/Requirements
:connects_to: [Definition/Vision, Specification/Concepts]
:flows_from: [SystemExecutiveSummary]

```{unit}
:title: AI Provider Flexibility Requirement
:type: system_requirement
:implements: multi_provider_support

This document outlines the architectural approach for integrating various third-party AI models and services, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs), within the Nucleus ecosystem. The strategy centers on **Nucleus M365 Persona Agents** and backend **Nucleus Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool/Server applications**.

**Core Requirement:** AI provider flexibility. While enterprise deployments might favor Azure OpenAI Service, other scenarios may benefit from Google Gemini or OpenRouter.AI. The primary mechanism for direct LLM interaction (chat completions, embeddings) within .NET components is the **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstraction layer.
```

```{unit}
:title: Advanced Agentic Patterns Requirement
:type: functional_requirement
:implements: cognitive_processing

Beyond basic LLM calls, this strategy incorporates advanced agentic patterns such as:
- **Parallel Conversational Reasoning ("Cognitive Forking")**
- **Automatic Prompt Caching** via provider capabilities
- **Multiple LLM models** (e.g., fast, cost-effective models for preliminary tasks and powerful models for deep synthesis) within a single agent workflow

These patterns maximize efficiency, depth of analysis, and the emergent intelligence of Nucleus M365 Persona Agents.
```

```{unit}
:title: Development Infrastructure Requirement
:type: infrastructure_requirement
:implements: development_support

.NET Aspire provides development-time convenience for orchestrating and configuring the various services (Agents, MCP Tools) during development, with some deployment configuration support. The primary runtime hosting of these services occurs through standard .NET hosting mechanisms, while Aspire facilitates development-time service discovery and configuration management.

- [M365 Agents Overview](../../Specification/Concepts/M365AgentsOverview.MDMD.md)
```

```{unit}
:title: Core LLM Interaction Abstraction
:type: technical_requirement
:implements: extensions_ai_integration

Nucleus leverages `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient` for chat completions and `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ITextEmbeddingGenerator` for generating text embeddings. These abstractions offer:

- **Provider Agnosticism:** Enables switching between AI providers (Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, etc.) with minimal code changes, primarily through configuration and dependency injection.
- **Flexibility & Extensibility:** Supports middleware for logging, caching, telemetry, and standardized function/tool integration.
- **Standardization:** Aligns with .NET best practices for AI integration.

**Primary Consumers:**
- **Nucleus M365 Persona Agents:** For core reasoning, response generation, and orchestrating MCP tool calls based on LLM decisions. These agents may use `IChatClient` and `ITextEmbeddingGenerator` directly or delegate these calls to the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`.
- **Nucleus MCP Tools:** Specific MCP tools might interact directly with LLMs:
  - `KnowledgeStore_McpServer`: May use `ITextEmbeddingGenerator` to create embeddings for `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records.
  - `LlmOrchestration_McpServer`: This server is a heavy user of `IChatClient` and `ITextEmbeddingGenerator`, providing centralized LLM interaction capabilities for agents or other MCP tools that choose to delegate.

The choice of whether an M365 Agent interacts with LLMs directly versus delegating to the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer` can be a dynamic configuration choice, influenced by factors like desired level of abstraction, specific caching strategies, or complex orchestration needs best handled centrally.
```

```{unit}
:title: Cognitive Forking Pattern Requirement
:type: functional_requirement
:implements: parallel_reasoning

To tackle complex problems requiring multi-faceted analysis or exploration of diverse information streams, Nucleus M365 Persona Agents can employ a "Cognitive Forking" strategy. This pattern, inspired by how human teams might divide and conquer a problem, involves the agent initiating multiple, concurrent conversational threads with its configured LLM.

**Concept and Workflow:**
1. **Task Decomposition:** The M365 Agent's `IPersonaRuntime` identifies an opportunity for parallel processing
2. **Shared Context & Forking:** A common baseline context is established, then the agent "forks" its reasoning by initiating N parallel conversational sessions with the LLM
3. **Parallel Execution:** Each conversational fork proceeds independently via the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`
4. **Output Collection:** The M365 Agent collects the outputs from all forks
5. **Consolidation & Synthesis:** The agent initiates a final LLM interaction to synthesize all fork outputs into a coherent result

**Variants and Considerations:**
- **"Left-Brain/Right-Brain" Analysis:** Forking with different configurations (analytical vs creative)
- **Iterative Forking:** Results from initial forks can inform new, more focused forks
- **`PersonaConfiguration`:** Includes parameters to manage forking (MaxConcurrentForks, strategy hints, consolidation prompts)
- **LLM Provider Capabilities:** Enhanced by providers with robust automatic prompt caching and concurrent session support
```

```{unit}
:title: Prompt Caching Strategy
:type: performance_requirement
:implements: automatic_caching

Modern LLM providers (including Google and Microsoft) are increasingly implementing automatic prompt caching, detecting cacheable portions of prompts and applying savings transparently. This reduces the implementation complexity for Nucleus while providing the benefits of prompt reuse across "Cognitive Forking" and iterative workflows.

- **Automatic Provider Caching:** Providers like Google automatically detect and cache reusable prompt segments, passing savings to users without requiring explicit cache management. Microsoft has similar capabilities with varying levels of aggressiveness across their offerings.
- **Implementation Approach:** Rather than implementing complex prompt cache management, Nucleus can leverage these automatic capabilities by structuring prompts in ways that maximize cache-hit potential (e.g., consistent prompt structures, shared context sections).
- **Cognitive Consolidation Benefits:** The automatic caching enables efficient reuse of cognitive "consolidations" across multiple cognitive "forks" without implementation overhead.
- **Impact:** Critical for making patterns like "Cognitive Forking" (with its shared initial context) and iterative refinement economically viable and performant, achieved through provider-level automation rather than explicit cache management.
```

```{unit}
:title: Multi-Model Strategy
:type: performance_requirement
:implements: cost_optimization

Recognizing that not all LLM tasks require the same level of reasoning power (or incur the same cost), Nucleus supports a multi-model strategy. M365 Persona Agents can be configured (via `PersonaConfiguration` and routing logic within `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`) to use different LLMs for different purposes:
- **Fast/Cost-Effective Models (e.g., Gemini 2.0-Flash, smaller GPT variants):** Ideal for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks such as initial data filtering or triage, generating brief summaries, simple Q&A or command parsing.
- **Powerful/Deep Reasoning Models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4 class):** Reserved for tasks requiring complex analysis and synthesis, nuanced understanding and generation, sophisticated tool use planning.
- **Shared Embedding Space:** Utilizing models from the same family can allow for consistent semantic understanding across tasks.
```

```{unit}
:title: AI Provider Configuration
:type: infrastructure_requirement
:implements: provider_abstraction

Nucleus supports multiple AI providers through configuration:

**Azure OpenAI Service**
- Integration: Native `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` support for Azure OpenAI chat completions and text embeddings.
- Configuration: `AI:AzureOpenAI:Endpoint`, `AI:AzureOpenAI:ApiKey`, `AI:AzureOpenAI:DeploymentName`

**Google Gemini**
- Integration: Custom `IChatClient`/`ITextEmbeddingGenerator` implementations for Gemini API
- Configuration: `AI:Gemini:ApiKey`, `AI:Gemini:Project`, model-specific settings

**OpenRouter.AI**
- Integration: Custom implementations to handle HTTP calls, authentication, and request/response mapping
- Configuration: `AI:OpenRouter:ApiKey`, `AI:OpenRouter:Endpoint`, specific model identifiers
```

```{unit}
:title: MCP Tool Integration Pattern
:type: integration_requirement
:implements: llm_tool_calling

The M365 Persona Agent's LLM utilizes its native function/tool calling features to invoke backend Nucleus MCP Tools. The M365 Agent employs an orchestration framework like **Semantic Kernel**:

1. **MCP Tool Definition:** Backend Nucleus MCP Tools define their capabilities per MCP standards
2. **Tool Discovery & Registration:** The M365 Agent's Semantic Kernel instance connects to these MCP Tools via Aspire service discovery
3. **LLM Interaction:** The Agent's LLM is made aware of these available functions
4. **LLM Decision & Invocation:** Based on user intent, the LLM generates structured function call requests
5. **Translation to MCP Call:** Semantic Kernel translates requests into formal MCP calls
6. **MCP Tool Execution:** The target MCP Tool executes its logic and returns results

.NET Aspire facilitates this by managing the lifecycle, configuration, and network discoverability of both the M365 Agent and the various MCP Tool services.
```

```{unit}
:title: Ephemeral Context Provisioning
:type: security_requirement
:implements: zero_trust_content

Nucleus adheres to a Zero Trust principle regarding persistent storage of raw user file content. Ephemeral context is provided to LLMs through a secure pipeline:

1. **Interaction:** M365 Agent receives an interaction with a file shared in Teams
2. **MCP Call for Content:** Agent calls the `FileAccess_McpTool` with an `ArtifactReference`
3. **Ephemeral Fetch:** The `FileAccess_McpTool` ephemerally retrieves the `ArtifactContent` using appropriate permissions
4. **Content Routing:** The content stream is returned to the Agent or routed to another MCP Tool
5. **Prompt Assembly:** The M365 Agent assembles the prompt including the ephemeral text content
6. **LLM Call:** The prompt is sent via the injected `IChatClient`
7. **Cleanup:** The ephemeral content stream is discarded after use
```

```{unit}
:title: Future AI Integration Considerations
:type: roadmap_requirement
:implements: evolution_planning

Future development considerations for AI integration:
- Maturation of provider-agnostic prompt caching standards and APIs within `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`
- Development of more sophisticated strategies within `IPersonaRuntime` for dynamically choosing between 'fast' and 'deep' models based on real-time task assessment
- Standardized protocols for inter-agent 'cognitive state' sharing or collaborative prompt construction, potentially leveraging advanced MCP features
