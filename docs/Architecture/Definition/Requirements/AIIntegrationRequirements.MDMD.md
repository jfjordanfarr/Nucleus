# Nucleus AI Integration Strategy

````{composition}
:title: AI Integration Requirements
:stratum: Definition/Requirements
:connects_to: [Definition/Vision, Specification/Concepts]
:flows_from: [SystemExecutiveSummary]

```{unit}
:title: AI Provider Flexibility Requirement
:type: system_requirement
:implements: multi_provider_support

This document outlines the architectural approach for integrating various third-party AI models and services, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs), within the Nucleus ecosystem. The strategy centers on **Nucleus M365 Persona Agents** and backend **Nucleus Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool/Server applications**.

**Core Requirement:** AI provider flexibility. While enterprise deployments might favor Azure OpenAI Service, other scenarios may benefit from Google Gemini or OpenRouter.AI. The primary mechanism for direct LLM interaction (chat completions, embeddings) within .NET components is the **`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`** abstraction layer.
```

```{unit}
:title: Advanced Agentic Patterns Requirement
:type: functional_requirement
:implements: cognitive_processing

Beyond basic LLM calls, this strategy incorporates advanced agentic patterns such as:
- **Parallel Conversational Reasoning ("Cognitive Forking")**
- **Automatic Prompt Caching** via provider capabilities
- **Multiple LLM models** (e.g., fast, cost-effective models for preliminary tasks and powerful models for deep synthesis) within a single agent workflow

These patterns maximize efficiency, depth of analysis, and the emergent intelligence of Nucleus M365 Persona Agents.
```

```{unit}
:title: Development Infrastructure Requirement
:type: infrastructure_requirement
:implements: development_support

.NET Aspire provides development-time convenience for orchestrating and configuring the various services (Agents, MCP Tools) during development, with some deployment configuration support. The primary runtime hosting of these services occurs through standard .NET hosting mechanisms, while Aspire facilitates development-time service discovery and configuration management.

```

```{unit}
:title: Core LLM Interaction Abstraction
:type: technical_requirement
:implements: extensions_ai_integration

Nucleus leverages `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient` for chat completions and `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ITextEmbeddingGenerator` for generating text embeddings. These abstractions offer:

- **Provider Agnosticism:** Enables switching between AI providers (Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, etc.) with minimal code changes, primarily through configuration and dependency injection.
- **Flexibility & Extensibility:** Supports middleware for logging, caching, telemetry, and standardized function/tool integration.
- **Standardization:** Aligns with .NET best practices for AI integration.

**Primary Consumers:**
- **Nucleus M365 Persona Agents:** For core reasoning, response generation, and orchestrating MCP tool calls based on LLM decisions. These agents may use `IChatClient` and `ITextEmbeddingGenerator` directly or delegate these calls to the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`.
- **Nucleus MCP Tools:** Specific MCP tools might interact directly with LLMs:
  - `KnowledgeStore_McpServer`: May use `ITextEmbeddingGenerator` to create embeddings for `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` records.
  - `LlmOrchestration_McpServer`: This server is a heavy user of `IChatClient` and `ITextEmbeddingGenerator`, providing centralized LLM interaction capabilities for agents or other MCP tools that choose to delegate.

The choice of whether an M365 Agent interacts with LLMs directly versus delegating to the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer` can be a dynamic configuration choice, influenced by factors like desired level of abstraction, specific caching strategies, or complex orchestration needs best handled centrally.
```

```{unit}
:title: Cognitive Forking Pattern Requirement
:type: functional_requirement
:implements: parallel_reasoning

To tackle complex problems requiring multi-faceted analysis or exploration of diverse information streams, Nucleus M365 Persona Agents can employ a "Cognitive Forking" strategy. This pattern, inspired by how human teams might divide and conquer a problem, involves the agent initiating multiple, concurrent conversational threads with its configured LLM.

**Concept and Workflow:**
1. **Task Decomposition:** The M365 Agent's `IPersonaRuntime` identifies an opportunity for parallel processing
2. **Shared Context & Forking:** A common baseline context is established, then the agent "forks" its reasoning by initiating N parallel conversational sessions with the LLM
3. **Parallel Execution:** Each conversational fork proceeds independently via the `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`
4. **Output Collection:** The M365 Agent collects the outputs from all forks
5. **Consolidation & Synthesis:** The agent initiates a final LLM interaction to synthesize all fork outputs into a coherent result

**Variants and Considerations:**
- **"Left-Brain/Right-Brain" Analysis:** Forking with different configurations (analytical vs creative)
- **Iterative Forking:** Results from initial forks can inform new, more focused forks
- **`PersonaConfiguration`:** Includes parameters to manage forking (MaxConcurrentForks, strategy hints, consolidation prompts)
- **LLM Provider Capabilities:** Enhanced by providers with robust automatic prompt caching and concurrent session support
```

### 3.1. Concept and Workflow

1.  **Task Decomposition:** The M365 Agent's `IPersonaRuntime` (guided by its `PersonaConfiguration` and the current task) identifies an opportunity for parallel processing. This could involve analyzing multiple documents simultaneously, exploring different hypotheses, or applying varied analytical lenses to the same data.
2.  **Shared Context & Forking:** A common baseline context (potentially benefiting from LLM provider-level prompt caching) is established. The agent then "forks" its reasoning by initiating `N` parallel conversational sessions with the LLM. Each fork receives the shared context plus a specific directive or data subset pertinent to its sub-task.
    *   _Example:_ Analyzing multiple log files; each fork processes one log file, looking for specific error patterns based on the shared overall issue description.
3.  **Parallel Execution:** Each conversational fork proceeds independently. The `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer` plays a key role in managing these concurrent sessions and passing through any prompt caching hints.
4.  **Output Collection:** The M365 Agent collects the outputs from all forks. These outputs may be conversational text, summaries, or semi-structured data.
5.  **Consolidation & Synthesis:** The agent then initiates a final LLM interaction, providing all collected outputs from the forks as input. The LLM is prompted to synthesize these diverse pieces of information into a single, coherent result, insight, or recommendation relevant to the original overarching task. This consolidation step is critical for deriving higher-order understanding.

### 3.2. Variants and Considerations

*   **"Left-Brain/Right-Brain" Analysis:** A variant involves forking a task to two LLM sessions with different configurations (e.g., one with low temperature for analytical precision, another with high temperature for creative brainstorming) and then synthesizing the results.
*   **Iterative Forking:** The process can be iterative. Results from an initial set of forks can inform the creation of new, more focused forks for deeper investigation.
*   **`PersonaConfiguration`:** Will include parameters to manage forking (e.g., `MaxConcurrentForks`, strategy hints, consolidation prompts).
*   **LLM Provider Capabilities:** The efficiency of this pattern is significantly enhanced by LLM providers that offer robust prompt caching and can handle concurrent sessions effectively. As of May 2025, services like Google Gemini provide granular caching APIs, and such capabilities are expected to improve across the industry.

## 4. Leveraging Prompt Caching and Multi-Model Strategies

### 4.1. Prompt Caching

Modern LLM providers (including Google and Microsoft) are increasingly implementing automatic prompt caching, detecting cacheable portions of prompts and applying savings transparently. This reduces the implementation complexity for Nucleus while providing the benefits of prompt reuse across "Cognitive Forking" and iterative workflows.

*   **Automatic Provider Caching:** Providers like Google automatically detect and cache reusable prompt segments, passing savings to users without requiring explicit cache management. Microsoft has similar capabilities with varying levels of aggressiveness across their offerings.
*   **Implementation Approach:** Rather than implementing complex prompt cache management, Nucleus can leverage these automatic capabilities by structuring prompts in ways that maximize cache-hit potential (e.g., consistent prompt structures, shared context sections).
*   **Cognitive Consolidation Benefits:** The automatic caching enables efficient reuse of cognitive "consolidations" across multiple cognitive "forks" without implementation overhead.
*   **Impact:** Critical for making patterns like "Cognitive Forking" (with its shared initial context) and iterative refinement economically viable and performant, achieved through provider-level automation rather than explicit cache management.

### 4.2. Multi-Model LLM Strategy (Fast & Deep)

Recognizing that not all LLM tasks require the same level of reasoning power (or incur the same cost), Nucleus supports a multi-model strategy. M365 Persona Agents can be configured (via `PersonaConfiguration` and routing logic within `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`) to use different LLMs for different purposes:
*   **Fast/Cost-Effective Models (e.g., Gemini 2.0-Flash, smaller GPT variants):** Ideal for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks such as:
    *   Initial data filtering or triage.
    *   Generating brief summaries of many small documents.
    *   Simple Q&A or command parsing.
*   **Powerful/Deep Reasoning Models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4 class):** Reserved for tasks requiring:
    *   Complex analysis and synthesis (like the consolidation step in Cognitive Forking).
    *   Nuanced understanding and generation.
    *   Sophisticated tool use planning.
*   **Shared Embedding Space:** Utilizing models from the same family (e.g., different versions of Gemini) can allow for consistent semantic understanding across tasks, as they often share the same underlying embedding space. This means context gathered or embeddings generated by a "flash" model can still be meaningfully used by a "pro" model.
*   **Orchestration:** The `IPersonaRuntime` within an M365 Agent, in conjunction with `Nucleus_LlmOrchestration_McpServer`, will manage the selection and invocation of the appropriate model based on the task at hand, guided by `PersonaConfiguration`.

## 5. Supported AI Providers & Configuration within .NET Aspire

Each Aspire-hosted service (Agent or MCP Tool) that requires direct LLM access will configure the desired `IChatClient` and `ITextEmbeddingGenerator` implementation in its `Program.cs`. This selection is driven by externalized configuration, managed by .NET Aspire, which can draw from Azure App Configuration and Azure Key Vault in production environments.

### 5.1. Azure OpenAI Service

*   **SDKs:** Official `Azure.AI.OpenAI` .NET SDK, which provides extensions for `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`.
*   **Authentication:** Managed Identity of the consuming Azure-hosted service (e.g., M365 Agent running in Azure App Service/Container Apps) is preferred.
*   **Configuration (via Aspire/App Config/Key Vault):** `AI:AzureOpenAI:Endpoint`, `AI:AzureOpenAI:ChatDeploymentName`, `AI:AzureOpenAI:EmbeddingDeploymentName`.

### 5.2. Google Gemini

*   **SDKs:** Official Google .NET SDK (e.g., `Google.Ai.Generativelanguage`) wrapped in a custom `IChatClient`/`ITextEmbeddingGenerator`, or community packages like `Mscc.GenerativeAI.Microsoft` if compatible.
*   **Configuration (via Aspire/App Config/Key Vault):** `AI:GoogleAI:ApiKey`, `AI:GoogleAI:ChatModel`, `AI:GoogleAI:EmbeddingModel`.

### 5.3. OpenRouter.AI

*   **Integration:** Requires a custom `IChatClient`/`ITextEmbeddingGenerator` implementation to handle HTTP calls, authentication (API key), and request/response mapping.
*   **Configuration (via Aspire/App Config/Key Vault):** `AI:OpenRouter:ApiKey`, `AI:OpenRouter:Endpoint`, specific model identifiers.

### 5.4. Dependency Injection Example (Conceptual)

Within an Aspire-managed service's `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// In Program.cs of an M365 Agent or MCP Tool service

// Configuration is loaded by Aspire (e.g., from appsettings.json, environment variables, Azure App Config)
var chosenProvider = builder.Configuration["AI:ProviderName"]; // e.g., "AzureOpenAI"

if (chosenProvider == "AzureOpenAI")
{
    builder.Services.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
        builder.Configuration.GetSection("AI:AzureOpenAI:Chat")
    );
    // Add AzureOpenAIEmbeddingGeneration similarly
}
else if (chosenProvider == "GoogleGemini")
{
    // Register custom or third-party Gemini IChatClient/ITextEmbeddingGenerator
    // services.AddSingleton<IChatClient, GeminiChatClient>(); 
}
// ... other providers

// Services then inject IChatClient or ITextEmbeddingGenerator
```

## 6. LLM Tool Calling of Backend Nucleus MCP Tools

This is a primary mode of AI integration, where the M365 Persona Agent's LLM invokes capabilities exposed by backend Nucleus MCP Tools. All involved services (Agent, MCP Tools) are orchestrated by .NET Aspire.

### 6.1. Mechanism

The M365 Persona Agent's LLM utilizes its native function/tool calling features.

### 6.2. Orchestration within the M365 Agent

The M365 Agent (an Aspire-hosted service) typically employs an orchestration framework like **Semantic Kernel**:

1.  **MCP Tool Definition:** Backend Nucleus MCP Tools (e.g., `KnowledgeStore_McpServer`) define their capabilities per MCP standards (name, description, JSON schema).
2.  **Tool Discovery & Registration:** The M365 Agent's Semantic Kernel instance connects to these MCP Tools. The endpoints for these tools are discoverable via .NET Aspire's service discovery mechanisms.
3.  Semantic Kernel represents these MCP Tools as `KernelFunction`s within its plugins.
4.  **LLM Interaction:** The Agent's LLM (invoked via `IChatClient`, often wrapped by Semantic Kernel's chat completion services) is made aware of these available `KernelFunction`s.
5.  **LLM Decision & Invocation:** Based on user intent, the LLM decides to call one or more MCP Tools and generates a structured function call request.
6.  **Translation to MCP Call:** Semantic Kernel (or custom agent logic) translates this request into a formal MCP call and dispatches it to the appropriate Nucleus MCP Tool service (its address resolved by Aspire).
7.  **MCP Tool Execution:** The target MCP Tool executes its logic.
8.  **Response to LLM:** The result is returned to Semantic Kernel/Agent, then to the LLM for formulating the final user response.

.NET Aspire facilitates this by managing the lifecycle, configuration, and network discoverability of both the M365 Agent and the various MCP Tool services.

## 7. Ephemeral Context Provisioning for LLMs

Nucleus adheres to a Zero Trust principle regarding persistent storage of raw user file content. Ephemeral context is provided to LLMs as follows:

1.  **Interaction:** M365 Agent receives an interaction (e.g., a message with a file shared in Teams).
2.  **MCP Call for Content:** Agent calls the `FileAccess_McpTool` (an Aspire-managed service) with an `ArtifactReference`.
3.  **Ephemeral Fetch:** The `FileAccess_McpTool` ephemerally retrieves the `ArtifactContent` (stream + metadata) from the user's M365 storage using appropriate permissions.
4.  **Content Routing:** The content stream is returned to the Agent or routed to another MCP Tool (e.g., `ContentProcessing_McpTool`, also an Aspire-managed service).
5.  **Prompt Assembly:** The M365 Agent (or a dedicated `LlmOrchestration_McpTool`) assembles the prompt for its configured LLM, including the ephemeral text content.
6.  **LLM Call:** The prompt is sent via the injected `IChatClient`.
7.  **Cleanup:** The ephemeral content stream is discarded after use.

## 8. Role of Semantic Kernel within M365 Persona Agents

Semantic Kernel is primarily utilized *within* each M365 Persona Agent service. Its role includes:

*   Managing interaction with the chosen LLM (via `IChatClient`).
*   Integrating backend Nucleus MCP Tools (as plugins/functions), whose endpoints are resolved by Aspire.
*   Handling complex prompt engineering, short-term conversational memory, and planning logic for the agent.

## 9. Future Considerations

*   "Maturation of provider-agnostic prompt caching standards and APIs within `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` or similar abstractions."
*   "Development of more sophisticated strategies within `IPersonaRuntime` for dynamically choosing between 'fast' and 'deep' models based on real-time task assessment."
*   "Standardized protocols for inter-agent 'cognitive state' sharing or collaborative prompt construction, potentially leveraging advanced MCP features."
