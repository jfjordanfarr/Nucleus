# Definition/Requirements Stratum

````{composition}
:title: Requirements Definition Bilayer
:stratum: Definition/Requirements
:connects_to: [Definition/Vision, Specification/Concepts]
:recursive_bilayer: true

```{unit}
:title: Vision-Level Requirements
:type: requirement_composition
:implements: high_level_constraints

High-level requirements that flow from the system vision and define fundamental constraints:

- [SecurityRequirements.MDMD.md](SecurityRequirements.MDMD.md) - Fundamental security governance requirements
- [PersonaConceptsRequirements.MDMD.md](PersonaConceptsRequirements.MDMD.md) - Core persona system requirements and constraints
```

```{unit}
:title: Implementation-Level Requirements
:type: requirement_specification
:implements: technical_constraints

Detailed technical requirements that define specific implementation constraints:

- [AIIntegrationRequirements.MDMD.md](AIIntegrationRequirements.MDMD.md) - AI integration strategy requirements with specific technical patterns and provider constraints

This demonstrates the recursive bilayer structure: even within the Requirements stratum, we have our own vision-level requirements (high-level constraints) and implementation-level requirements (technical specifications).
```

```{unit}
:title: Requirements Flow Pattern
:type: documentation_pattern
:implements: progressive_constraint_refinement

Requirements flow from Definition/Vision → Definition/Requirements → Specification/Concepts → Specification/Implementations, with each stratum containing its own bilayer of definitions and specifications (recursive bilayer architecture).

This ensures that constraints are progressively refined from high-level vision through specific implementation details, maintaining traceability and coherence throughout the system specification.
