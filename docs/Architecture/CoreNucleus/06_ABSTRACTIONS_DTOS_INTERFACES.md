## 7. Domain Model Evolution: Balancing Anemic DTOs and Rich Domain Objects

The current domain models and DTOs in Nucleus (e.g., `ArtifactMetadata`, `PersonaKnowledgeEntry`, `PersonaConfiguration`) primarily serve as data containers with minimal embedded behavior. This anemic approach is a deliberate starting point, particularly for objects that frequently cross service boundaries (as DTOs for MCP Tools) or are bound from configuration. This prioritizes simplicity, ease of serialization, and clear data contracts.

However, Nucleus's evolution strategy for its core domain entities follows the principle: **"Start anemic, enrich as needed."**

*   **Initial State:** Models are simple data holders, easy to understand, serialize, and pass between M365 Agents and MCP Tools.
*   **Selective Enrichment:** As the system matures and specific business logic or validation rules are clearly and intrinsically tied to a particular data entity, that entity can be selectively enriched.
    *   This might involve transitioning a C# `record` to a `class` if mutable state or more complex internal methods are required for that entity *within a specific domain boundary* (e.g., within `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` or `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel`).
    *   Methods could be added to these classes to encapsulate logic that directly operates on their state, promoting higher cohesion.
*   **Guiding Principle:** The decision to enrich a model from a simple DTO/POCO to a richer domain object will be based on whether it improves clarity, reduces coupling in service layers (by moving relevant behavior into the object itself), and enhances encapsulation without unduly increasing the complexity of data transfer or serialization across service boundaries.
*   **Context is Key:** Not all data structures need to become rich domain objects. DTOs for simple data transfer will remain prevalent. Richness will be applied where it adds clear architectural value, such as for complex state management within an entity or for enforcing sophisticated invariants.

This pragmatic approach allows for agility in the early stages of development while providing a clear path towards more expressive and behavior-rich domain models where they offer the most benefit, particularly within the core domain logic libraries like `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic` and `Nucleus.Shared.Kernel`.
