# Nucleus Architecture Documentation (MDMD Format)

````{composition}
:title: Architecture Documentation Navigation
:stratum: Meta/Navigation
:connects_to: [Definition/Vision, Definition/Requirements, Specification/Concepts, Specification/Implementations]

```{unit}
:title: MDMD Structure Overview
:type: documentation_architecture
:implements: membrane_design_organization

This directory contains the Nucleus platform architecture documentation organized according to Membrane Design Markdown (MDMD) principles, implementing a recursive bilayer architecture where each stratum contains its own bilayer of definitions and specifications.
```

```{unit}
:title: Definition Stratum
:type: documentation_stratum
:implements: system_definition

High-level vision and requirements that define what the system should be and do.

- **[Vision/](Definition/Vision/)** - Foundational architectural vision and system overview documents (compositions)
- **[Requirements/](Definition/Requirements/)** - Core requirements and constraints (units and multi-requirements)
```

```{unit}
:title: Specification Stratum
:type: documentation_stratum
:implements: system_specification

Detailed specifications and implementation guidance that define how the system works.

- **[Concepts/](Specification/Concepts/)** - Architectural concepts, patterns, and designs (compositions)
- **[Implementations/](Specification/Implementations/)** - Specific implementation guides and tool documentation (units with 1:1 mappings)
```

```{unit}
:title: Navigation Guide
:type: documentation_flow
:implements: progressive_specification

Start with the Vision documents to understand the overall system architecture, then dive into specific Requirements, Concepts, and Implementations as needed.

**Key entry points:**
- [System Executive Summary](Definition/Vision/SystemExecutiveSummary.MDMD.md) - High-level system overview
- [Comprehensive Architecture Guide](Definition/Vision/ComprehensiveArchitectureGuide.MDMD.md) - Detailed architectural vision
- [M365 Agents Overview](Specification/Concepts/M365AgentsOverview.MDMD.md) - Core agent concepts
- [MCP Tools Overview](Specification/Concepts/McpToolsOverview.MDMD.md) - Backend tool concepts
```
