# Nucleus Project Execution Plan (MDMD Format)

This directory contains the Nucleus project execution planning documentation organized according to Membrane Design Markdown (MDMD) principles.

## Structure

The documentation is organized into two primary strata:

### Definition Stratum
High-level project vision and requirements that define what needs to be built and why.

- **[Vision/](Definition/Vision/)** - Project mandate and foundational vision (compositions)
- **[Requirements/](Definition/Requirements/)** - Phase-specific requirements and specifications (units and multi-requirements)

### Specification Stratum
Detailed execution plans and implementation strategies that define how the project will be delivered.

- **[Concepts/](Specification/Concepts/)** - Strategic planning concepts and roadmaps (compositions)  
- **[Implementations/](Specification/Implementations/)** - Phase-specific implementation tasks and deliverables (units with 1:1 mappings)

## Navigation

Start with the Vision to understand the project mandate, then review Requirements by phase, and finally examine the corresponding implementation strategies.

Key entry points:
- [Project Mandate](Definition/Vision/ProjectMandate.MDMD.md) - Core project vision and imperative
- [Development Roadmap](Specification/Concepts/DevelopmentRoadmap.MDMD.md) - Strategic development planning
- [Phase 1 MVP Requirements](Definition/Requirements/Phase1MVP.MDMD.md) - Foundation requirements
- [Phase 1 MVP Tasks](Specification/Implementations/Phase1MVPTasks.MDMD.md) - Implementation tasks
