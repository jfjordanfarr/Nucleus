# Phase 3 Tasks: Advanced Intelligence, Dynamic Config & System Hardening

**Epic:** [`EPIC_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE`](./00_TASKS_ROADMAP.md#epic_phase3_advanced_intelligence)
**Requirements:** [`./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md`](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md)

This document details the specific tasks required to complete Phase 3, focusing on enhancing the intelligence, configurability, and robustness of the Nucleus platform, particularly the M365 Agents and their interactions with Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools.

## `ISSUE-P3-RAG-PIPELINE-001`: Develop and Integrate `Nucleus_RAGPipeline_McpServer`

*Primary Location: `Nucleus.McpTools.RAGPipeline`, `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic`, M365 Agents (e.g., `Nucleus.Agents.EduFlow`)*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-RAG-DEV-01:** Develop `Nucleus_RAGPipeline_McpServer` implementing hybrid search (vector + keyword/metadata via `KnowledgeStoreMCP`) and 4R ranking algorithms from `Nucleus.Domain.RAGLogic`.
    *   Define MCP operations for `SearchAndRank`.
    *   Integrate with `KnowledgeStoreMCP` for initial data retrieval.
    *   Implement configurable 4R ranking (Recency, Relevancy, Richness, Reputation).
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-RAG-AGENT-INT-01:** Integrate M365 Persona Agents to call `RAGPipelineMCP.SearchAndRank` for context retrieval to inform responses.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-RAG-HISTORY-01:** Implement logic in M365 Agents to store conversation history snippets (user query + agent response) as `PersonaKnowledgeEntry` (via `KnowledgeStoreMCP.SavePersonaKnowledgeEntry`) for semantic memory, distinguishing them via `ArtifactMetadata.SourceType`.

## `ISSUE-P3-PERSONA-ADV-01`: Advanced Persona Logic & Tool Orchestration in M365 Agents

*Primary Location: M365 Agents (e.g., `Nucleus.Agents.EduFlow`), `Nucleus.Domain.Personas.Core`*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-AGENT-STRATEGY-01:** Enhance `IPersonaRuntime` in M365 Agents to support `MultiStepReasoning` and `ToolUsing` strategies for orchestrating multiple MCP tool calls (e.g., `RAGPipelineMCP`, `FileAccessMCP`).
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-AGENT-SYNTH-01:** Enable M365 Agents to synthesize information from multiple MCP tool outputs and retrieved context (from `RAGPipelineMCP`) to generate comprehensive answers.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-AGENT-LLMFEAT-01:** Ensure M365 Agents (via `IChatClient` or a potential `LlmOrchestrationMCP`) can leverage advanced LLM features like tool/function calling provided by the LLM itself for complex interactions.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-AGENT-DYNCONF-01:** Implement logic in M365 Agents to load and use dynamic `PersonaConfiguration` elements (prompts, parameters, tool access rules) retrieved from `Nucleus_PersonaBehaviourConfig_McpServer`.

## `ISSUE-P3-MCPTOOL-PERSONACONFIG-001`: Develop `Nucleus_PersonaBehaviourConfig_McpServer`

*Primary Location: `Nucleus.McpTools.PersonaBehaviourConfig`*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-PBC-INIT-01:** Initialize `Nucleus.McpTools.PersonaBehaviourConfig` .NET project.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-PBC-OPS-01:** Define and implement MCP operations for reading dynamic `PersonaConfiguration` elements (prompts, parameters, tool access rules). Include admin-only operations for writing/updating configurations.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-PBC-STORE-01:** Integrate with `Nucleus.Infrastructure.CosmosDb` for persistence of `PersonaConfiguration` data, ensuring appropriate tenant/persona scoping and versioning.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-PBC-TEST-01:** Write unit and integration tests for the `Nucleus_PersonaBehaviourConfig_McpServer`.

## `ISSUE-P3-CACHING-001`: Implement Caching Strategy

*Primary Location: `Nucleus.Infrastructure.Caching` (New Project), M365 Agents, `Nucleus.McpTools.LlmOrchestration` (Conceptual)*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-CACHE-DEF-01:** Define `ICacheManagementService` abstraction in `Nucleus.Abstractions` (or a shared kernel project).
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-CACHE-IMPL-01:** Implement `ICacheManagementService` (e.g., in-memory for development, Azure Cache for Redis for production) in a new `Nucleus.Infrastructure.Caching` project.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-CACHE-INTEG-01:** Integrate caching for LLM calls (within a potential `LlmOrchestrationMCP` or directly in M365 Agents where `IChatClient` is used) and/or frequently accessed/expensive MCP Tool responses (e.g., `RAGPipelineMCP` outputs, `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` data).

## `ISSUE-P3-BACKEND-ENH-01`: Backend Enhancements (Logging, Monitoring, Security)

*Primary Location: All MCP Tool Projects, M365 Agent Projects, Aspire AppHost*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-LOG-01:** Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) and structured logging with correlation IDs across M365 Agents and all deployed MCP Tools.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-MONITOR-01:** Set up initial Application Insights monitoring for all deployed MCP Tools, capturing request rates, latencies, errors, and dependency calls.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-SEC-01:** Review and harden authentication/authorization mechanisms for all MCP Tool endpoints.
    *   Ensure MCP Tools validate callers (e.g., M365 Agent App ID via client assertion or similar).
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-SEC-02:** Ensure all sensitive configuration (API keys, connection strings) for MCP Tools and Agents is stored securely in Azure Key Vault and accessed via managed identities.

## `ISSUE-P3-SYSTEM-TESTING-001`: Establish System Integration Testing

*Primary Location: `tests/Nucleus.System.IntegrationTests` (New Project)*

*   [ ] **TASK-P3-TEST-MCPUNIT-01:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for new MCP Tools (`RAGPipelineMCP`, `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`).
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-TEST-SYS-ASPIRE-01:** Implement system integration tests using .NET Aspire (`Aspire.Hosting.Testing`) covering key end-to-end flows:
    *   M365 Agent -> `RAGPipelineMCP` -> `KnowledgeStoreMCP` -> (mocked) AI Model.
    *   M365 Agent -> `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP` -> Cosmos DB.
    *   Simulate M365 Graph API responses for `FileAccessMCP` if involved in tested flows.
*   [ ] **TASK-P3-TEST-AGENTLOGIC-01:** Write unit tests for new/enhanced M365 Agent `IPersonaRuntime` strategies (multi-step reasoning, tool use) and decision logic for using MCP tools.
