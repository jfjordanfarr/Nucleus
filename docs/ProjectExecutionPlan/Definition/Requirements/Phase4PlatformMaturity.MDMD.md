# Requirements: Phase 4 - Platform Maturity & Operational Excellence

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2025-05-27

## 1. Goal

To mature the Nucleus platform into an enterprise-grade system by enhancing operational excellence, refining interactions for **Microsoft 365 Agents** and their underlying **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools**, implementing robust workflow orchestration for complex background tasks, and providing comprehensive administrative, security, and deployment features. This phase ensures the platform is scalable, manageable, secure, and ready for diverse operational scenarios, solidifying its enterprise readiness.

## 2. Scope

*   **Primary Focus (Platform Maturation):**
    *   **Enhanced M365 Agent UX & MCP Tool Interactions:** Implementing richer, more interactive experiences within M365 host applications (e.g., using Adaptive Cards in Teams/Outlook) driven by M365 Agents, which in turn leverage backend MCP Tools.
    *   **Workflow Orchestration for Background Tasks:** Utilizing `Nucleus.BackgroundWorker.ServiceBus` for managing complex, stateful, long-running, or multi-step background tasks initiated by M365 Agents (which may involve sequences of MCP Tool calls). Azure Durable Functions may be used as an internal implementation detail within this worker service if complex stateful orchestration logic is required.
    *   **Advanced Admin Capabilities:** Developing comprehensive administrative functionalities, potentially exposed via dedicated **Admin MCP Tools** (e.g., `Admin.GetSystemLogsMcpTool`, `Admin.ManagePersonaConfigMcpTool`) consumed by an Admin UI (web application) or a specialized Admin M365 Agent. These capabilities include system monitoring, management of dynamic `PersonaConfiguration` (via `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`), viewing logs, and potentially tenant management for an ISV offering.
    *   **Security Hardening & Compliance:** Implementing advanced security measures, data protection policies, and features to support compliance with relevant standards across the M365 Agent and MCP Tool ecosystem.
    *   **Deployment Automation & Operational Procedures:** Establishing fully automated deployment pipelines (IaC), comprehensive monitoring/alerting, and well-defined operational procedures (backup, recovery, scaling) for the entire distributed system.
*   **Foundation:** Builds upon the advanced intelligence and system hardening established in Phase 3 ([`./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md`](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md)).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Enhanced M365 Agent / MCP Tool Interactions

*   **REQ-MAT-UX-001:** M365 Agents MUST be capable of generating rich, interactive outputs (e.g., Adaptive Cards with action buttons, input fields) for rendering in M365 host applications, based on data retrieved or processed by MCP Tools.
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-002:** The M365 Agent and supporting backend (potentially a dedicated "CallbackMCP" or similar mechanism) MUST be able to handle callbacks and actions initiated from these rich UI elements (e.g., button clicks in an Adaptive Card triggering a subsequent MCP Tool call or M365 Agent action).
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-003:** MCP Tools SHOULD provide clear schemas for inputs and outputs that allow M365 Agents to easily construct rich UI elements and process responses.
*   **REQ-MAT-UX-004:** Conversational flows driven by M365 Agents SHOULD be enhanced for natural interaction, with Personas capable of clarifying ambiguous requests or prompting for necessary information using M365-native patterns, leveraging context from MCP Tools.

### 3.2. Workflow Orchestration for Background Tasks

*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-001:** The `Nucleus.BackgroundWorker.ServiceBus` service MUST manage complex, stateful, or long-running background tasks offloaded by M365 Agents (e.g., processing large files via `ContentProcessingMCP`, complex analysis chains). Azure Durable Functions MAY be used internally by this service for sophisticated stateful orchestration logic.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-002:** Asynchronous tasks involving sequences of MCP Tool calls (e.g., `FileAccessMCP` -> `ContentProcessingMCP` -> `KnowledgeStoreMCP`) MUST be managed by `Nucleus.BackgroundWorker.ServiceBus` for better state tracking, error handling, and visibility.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-003:** The background worker framework MUST support patterns like fan-out/fan-in for parallel MCP Tool invocations, long-running timers, and potentially human-in-the-loop steps facilitated via M365 Agent prompts.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-004:** The status of background workflows MUST be queryable, potentially via a dedicated MCP Tool (e.g., `WorkflowStatusMCP`) or an admin-focused MCP Tool, allowing M365 Agents or administrators to provide updates.
*   **REQ-MAT-ORC-005:** Background workflows MUST implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms (with backoff), and compensation logic for sequences of MCP Tool calls where appropriate.

### 3.3. Enterprise Readiness & Admin Features

*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-001:** Administrative functionalities MUST be provided, potentially via a suite of **Admin-focused MCP Tools** (e.g., `Admin.GetSystemLogsMcpTool`, `Admin.ManagePersonaConfigMcpTool`, `Admin.ViewWorkflowStatusMcpTool`). These tools would be consumed by a dedicated Admin UI (web application) or a specialized Admin M365 Agent.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-002 (Monitoring & Logging):** Administrators, using Admin MCP Tools or a dedicated UI, MUST be able to:
    *   View aggregated system logs from all components (M365 Agents, MCP Tools, Background Workers).
    *   Monitor the health, performance, and resource utilization of all Nucleus backend services.
    *   Configure alerts for critical system events or performance degradation.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-003 (Persona Management):** Administrators, using Admin MCP Tools, MUST be able to:
    *   View registered Nucleus Personas and their configurations.
    *   Manage dynamic aspects of `PersonaConfiguration` (e.g., prompts, tool access rules) by interacting with `Nucleus_PersonaBehaviourConfig_McpServer`.
    *   Enable/disable Personas for M365 Agent discovery.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-004 (Configuration Management):** Administrators, using Admin MCP Tools, SHOULD be able to manage non-sensitive static application settings (potentially by interacting with Azure App Configuration or similar) and view the status of dynamic configurations managed by `PersonaBehaviourConfigMCP`.
*   **REQ-MAT-ADM-005 (Tenant Management - for Multi-Tenant Cloud-Hosted):** If the cloud-hosted Nucleus supports multiple tenants, Admin MCP Tools MUST provide capabilities to manage tenant lifecycles, resource isolation (if applicable), and view tenant-specific usage/analytics.

### 3.4. Security, Compliance & Governance

*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-001 (Data Protection):** Implement robust data protection measures for data at rest (Cosmos DB, Cache) and in transit across all M365 Agent and MCP Tool communications, including encryption and access controls. Adhere to principles of least privilege.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-002 (Audit Trails):** Comprehensive audit trails MUST be implemented for significant system events, administrative actions (via Admin MCP Tools), and data access/modification by MCP Tools. Logs should be securely stored and tamper-evident.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-003 (Identity & Access Management):** Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID for administrative access to Admin MCP Tools and any Admin UI. M365 Agent interactions will rely on the M365 identity and permission model, and MCP Tools will authorize based on the M365 Agent's identity.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-004 (Compliance):** The platform design, including all MCP Tools and Agent interactions, SHOULD consider common compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2) and facilitate adherence.
*   **REQ-MAT-SEC-005 (Vulnerability Management):** Regular security assessments, penetration testing (covering M365 Agent attack vectors and MCP Tool security), and a process for addressing identified vulnerabilities MUST be established.

### 3.5. Deployment & Operations

*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-001 (Automated Deployments):** Fully automated CI/CD pipelines MUST be implemented for deploying all Nucleus components (M365 Agent manifests/packages, MCP Tools, Background Workers, Admin UI, infrastructure changes) to Azure environments.
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-002 (Infrastructure as Code):** All Azure infrastructure supporting the M365 Agents, MCP Tools, and backend services MUST be managed using IaC (Bicep or Terraform).
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-003 (Scalability & Resilience):** All MCP Tools and backend services MUST be designed and configured for scalability and high availability.
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-004 (Backup & Recovery):** Automated backup procedures for critical data stores (Cosmos DB metadata, configuration) MUST be in place. Disaster recovery plans for the entire distributed system MUST be documented and periodically tested.
*   **REQ-MAT-DEP-005 (Operational Monitoring & Alerting):** Comprehensive operational monitoring (extending REQ-MAT-ADM-002) with automated alerting for critical issues across the M365 Agent and MCP Tool ecosystem MUST be established.

## 4. Non-Goals (This Phase)

*   Introducing new core AI functionalities beyond refining existing Persona capabilities and their orchestration via M365 Agents and MCP Tools.
*   Expanding to fundamentally new third-party platform integrations outside the M365 ecosystem or generic MCP client scenarios already defined.
*   Developing a full-featured, standalone Nucleus web portal for end-users (interaction remains primarily via M365 Agents).

## 5. Key Dependencies & Linkages

*   **Microsoft 365 Developer Platform:** For Adaptive Cards, M365 Agent SDK, Microsoft Graph APIs, and admin integration points.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification:** For ensuring continued interoperability of all MCP Tools.
*   **Azure Services:** Deep reliance on Azure for hosting (App Services, Functions for MCP Tools and Workers), orchestration (`Nucleus.BackgroundWorker.ServiceBus`, potentially Azure Durable Functions), database (Cosmos DB), messaging (Service Bus), caching, monitoring (Application Insights), security (Key Vault, Microsoft Entra ID), and deployment (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions).
*   **Phase 3 Requirements:** [`./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md`](./03_REQUIREMENTS_PHASE3_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE.md) - This phase builds directly upon its deliverables.
*   **Architecture Documents:** All relevant Nucleus architecture documents, especially those covering M365 Agents, MCP Tools, Security, and Deployment.
